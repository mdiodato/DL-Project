        "description": "Monument to the Bandeiras (The Monument to the Flags) is a large-scale sculpture by the Italian-Brazilian sculptor Victor Brecheret (1894-1955) at the entrance of Ibirapuera Park in São Paulo, Brazil.[1] It was commissioned by the government of São Paulo in 1921 and completed in 1954. It commemorates the 17th-century bandeiras, or settling expeditions into the interior of Brazil. The monument, given its size and location, has now become an integral part of the landscape of São Paulo.[2]\n\nThe monument was erected in the south-central area of the city in the Praça Armando Salles de Oliveira (Armando Salles de Oliveira Square), opposite the Palácio 9 de Julho, headquarters of the Legislative Assembly of the State of São Paulo."
