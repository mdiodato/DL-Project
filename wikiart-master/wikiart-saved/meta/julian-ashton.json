        "description": "Julian Ashton's 'Evening, Merri Creek' 1882, was claimed by the artist as the first true 'plein air' oil painting in Australia, and therefore a key example for his encouragement of young artists to work directly in the open.\r\n\r\nWhen Ashton first exhibited his painting of the tranquil waterway near Melbourne, a reviewer commented:\r\n\"Mr Ashton has also on view a large landscape in oils, called 'Winter's Evening', a view on the Merri Creek. It is the time when the light is low, just before the sun sinks to its rest. The whole landscape is suffused with a glow from the setting luminary striking athwart the valley, lighting up the middle distance, which is very well rendered, and shimmering over the surface of the shallow water, above which some swallows are winging their arrowy flight. Gum trees line the sloping sides of the stream, the foreground being broken up with large boulders and reeds, the near foreground falling into shadow, which, like the crest of the ploughed field in the distance, is growing grey as sober evening with dewy fingers draws 'The gradual dusky veil'. The tone and colour of the landscape is very agreeable, the water admirable, and the whole work is in good keeping\".\r\n'The Australasian sketcher with pen and pencil', Melbourne, 11 November 1882\r\n\r\nThe Merri Creek runs for approximately 70 kms, beginning near Wallan, a town on Melbourne's northern outskirts, and joining the Yarra River at Dight's fall, Collingwood."

        "description": "Julian Ashton deliberately fostered an identifiable Australian Art and he was to prove enormously influential in the capacity of administrator and teacher in Sydney in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Ashton's most consistent advice was to paint the landscape, in front of the motif and although his own canvases rarely bear witness to this advice, many significant painters in the early twentieth century heeded it.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Ashton and A.J. Daplyn camped on the banks of the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney, and this work is a result of that trip. Sketching for the 'Picturesque Atlas of Australasia' made Ashton more aware of particular traits of specific locales and painting with Buvelot in 1880 may also have heightened a receptivity to different atmospheric effects. Under Ashton's influence Richmond and the Hawkesbury were to become much frequented by artists in subsequent decades."

He moved to Sydney in 1883 to work on 'The picturesque atlas of Australasia'. Ashton was a major influence on the appreciation and teaching of art in Sydney, establishing his own art school, which still operates today. He was President of the Art Society of NSW and a trustee of the AGNSW.\r\n\r\nAccording to his autobiography, 'Now came still evening on' (1941) pg 53 Ashton visited an Aboriginal camp some miles out of Kiama on the south coast of NSW, where he remembered seeing \"a fine looking native and his two lubras… They lived in a little construction something like an Indian wigwam. They had two children – a boy of about six years and the other just out of babyhood. I persuaded the father to allow me to make a drawing of them. He stood with his hand out and holding the younger child in his arms.\""

        "description": "Ashton's 'Sentry-box Reach' was painted when he was a staff artist for The picturesque atlas of Australasia; a position which allowed him to travel widely. The Hawkesbury soon became a favourite haunt for painting. He returned to it frequently with artist friends. 'Sentry-box Reach' is a classic example of nineteenth-century British watercolour technique – transparent washes of watercolour over barely perceptible pencil outlines, occasionally with some minor scraping out for highlights. It is a particularly convincing study of the expanse and conditions of the Hawkesbury landscape."

'A solitary ramble' is one of the best known watercolours in the collection. Its depiction of leisured, rural life in nineteenth century Australia reflects the growing sense of national pride that was evolving in colonial society, which formed an identity closely associated with the bush.\r\n\r\nThe female figure with a parasol is the artist's wife, shown in a lane behind Griffith's Orchard in Richmond, near Sydney, NSW."

        "description": "Julian Ashton was one of the most influential figures in the Sydney art world from his arrival here in 1883 to work on the Picturesque atlas of Australasia. He took a leading role in the Art Society of NSW, which undertook art instruction and exhibitions for the most significant artists of the day and was an early Trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales (1889-99), where he championed the collection of contemporary Australian art by the Gallery. However it was the example Ashton set as a painter and as a teacher at his eponymous Sydney Art School (est. 1890) that was to have the most profound effect on a generation of ‘Bohemian’ artists who wished to forge a distinctively independent school of painters of Australian life and landscape.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this atmospheric, poetic watercolour is the ferry wharf at Mosman’s Bay – a popular subject for a number of artists associated with the artists’ camps of Mosman in the 1880s and 90s. Situated in the next bay, Little Sirius Cove, was the artists’ Curlew Camp, and further to the north was the Edwards Beach camp, (today’s Balmoral Beach), where Ashton was a frequent resident. This watercolour was painted the same year his other watercolour, 'A solitary ramble' 1880, was acquired by the AGNSW.\r\n\r\nDepicted in the centre of the painting is Lewis’s Refreshment Rooms, built next to the wharf and a focus of leisure for leisure and relaxation, although a place of comparative bustle and activity compared to the more isolated artists’ camps nearby. Ashton championed the practice of painting outdoors (en plein air); this work captures the impressions of nature – sunlight, haze, water – as well as the human activity by the foreshore, witnessed in all its prosaic everyday-ness by the artist in its midst."
