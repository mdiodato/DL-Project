        "description": "This painting is fusion-painting, created by Ben Vollers & Fons Heijnsbroek, the painter-duo BenFo (Ben&Fons) in the old mill 'The Hope', during the public art-manifestation Lek-Art 2008 in the small river-city Culemborg.\r\nThey painted during the manifestation en public circa 6 mill-paintings: Mill-with-a-view - by painting together, side by side on one large canvas.\r\nThe painting Arabesque was the last and the most colorful one.\r\nInspiration was the river-landscape of the Dutch river Lek, Heijnsbroek and Vollers could view very wide from the mill of Culemborg - and the many river-scapes painted by famous painters as Ruysdael and Gabriel.\r\nThe interior of the floor of the mill was their temporary studio where they painted the series Mill-with-a-views.  \r\n"
