        "description": "Paul Kane painted this portrait of Freeman Clench as one of a pair, to be hung with the portrait of Freeman’s wife, Eliza Clench. These pendant portraits represent Kane’s initial plan for earning his living as an artist. They date from his two-year period in Cobourg, Ontario, when he took advantage of social connections to develop his skills in portraiture. He would have known the Clenches either through working for the Clench furniture business or through his contact with Wilson S. Conger, Kane’s former employer in Toronto who moved to Cobourg in 1829 and became a prominent citizen through his positions in municipal office.1 \r\n          The paintings portray the Clenches as fashionably dressed, and Eliza’s gold locket and earrings are especially indicative of the family’s status. Kane’s society portraits from this period reflect a professional competence within a naive, linear style. While some sense of the individual sitters is discernible, the elongated necks, enhanced by the fashion of the period, and the patterning of hair and costume mimic a stylization typical of portraiture at the time. The plain background with a broad halo effect behind the head is a focusing device Kane would continue to use throughout his career.\r\n          Although neither Clench portrait is signed (typical of Kane), they have been attributed to Kane based on the comparison of the pigments with the contents of his studio paint box,2  as well as on his close relationship with the Clench family. Both portraits were handed down through the family until their acquisition by the National Gallery of Canada in 1990."

        "description": "In his field journal Kane records his encounter with the Cree chief Kee-akee-ka-saa-ka-wow on July 14, 1846, and elaborates that he “is the man that always speekes [speaks], the last” and he “dilliveres [delivers] his ordere in a low tone in his hert [heart].”  This watercolour appears to have been executed fairly rapidly, with the chief’s chest and right arm brushed in with a few broad strokes. Kane focuses on the face, noting its variations in structure: the pronounced mouth area, the heavier lower lip, the slack skin of the cheeks as they start sliding into jowls, the lined forehead. Kee-akee-ka-saa-ka-wow’s lower jaw and his shifted glance are visually reinforced by red facial paint.\r\n          The comparison between Kane’s watercolour Kee-akee-ka-saa-ka-wow, “The Man That Gives the War Whoop”   and his later oil painting of the same subject is one of the most oft-cited examples of the extent to which Kane modified the essence of a sitter. \r\n          In painting the oil, Kane transforms his subject into a man whose expression has been neutralized through elongation and even idealization of the features. Kee-akee-ka-saa-ka-wow, now set against a backdrop of a foreboding sky, looks beyond the viewer. All the accoutrements, all the markers of “Indianness”—the pipe stem, the fringed shirt, the roach headdress—are marshalled to communicate the gravitas that the original watercolour evokes through physiognomy alone."

        "description": "Scene in the Northwest—Portrait of John Henry Lefroy  is unique in Kane’s oeuvre in that it embraces portraiture and landscape equally, both key genres for Kane. \r\n          The scene depicts John Henry Lefroy, director of the Toronto Magnetic Observatory from 1841 to 1853, who wintered at Lake Athabasca during 1843–44 in his successful search for the magnetic north. In his autobiography Lefroy mentions how he was equipped for the winter with a “warm capote of thick white duffle, trimmed with red, and a blue hood,” and another in grey for his companion Corporal Henry.  Lefroy also mentions by name the three-dog team (Papillon, Milord, and Cartouche) that returned him to the Mackenzie River in March 1844 and describes them as having bells and red collars.  Only Lefroy would have known the details that appear in this painting, suggesting that he gave Kane art direction for the essential components of the portrait and that Kane’s painting of Lefroy in a northern landscape was the scientist’s personal commemoration of his achievement. \r\n          This portrait, likely painted sometime between December 1845 and April 1846, gives us a glimpse of how Kane may have used his client connections to advance his career. In 1843 Lefroy had solicited approval from Sir George Simpson, governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, for his own trek into the Northwest. In early 1846 Lefroy would in turn write a letter of support to Simpson on Kane’s behalf for the artist’s request for the same privilege. \r\n          When the portrait was first exhibited in 1847 at the Toronto Society of Arts,  its title, “Scene in the Northwest—Portrait,” focused on the locale rather than the identity of the person. Featuring the “white man” as explorer in Canada’s Northwest, the painting showcases a role that Kane was undertaking at that very moment."

        "description": "Previous research has assumed that Kane’s works on paper were sketched from life. However, this oil on paper, Medicine Pipe Stem Dance, was likely painted by Kane after the event, as a study for the later oil painting. It lacks the immediacy of a sketch drawn from life. \r\n          Kane makes no reference in his field journal to the pipe stem dance; if we are to believe his book Wanderings of an Artist among the Indians of North America, the Blackfoot ceremony took place in the afternoon and included Kane as one of the observers in the circle of seated men. (He was invited to the ceremony, as artist, to “add magical powers in increasing its efficacy.”1) The study spotlights the two dancers, and the vantage point is elevated, giving a more expansive view of dancers, spectators, and landscape. Kane’s depiction of the pipe stems suggests they were inspired by his drawings of individual cultural objects rather than by experience. In this painting Kane has chosen to depict a pipe stem from the very enemy nation (Plains Cree) that the Blackfoot were preparing to engage in battle.2  This seeming inconsistency may well underline Kane’s constructed approach to this work.\r\n          The oil painting based on the study was an early creation in Kane’s cycle of one hundred paintings. The canvas was one of eight “Indian pictures” Kane exhibited at the Upper Canada Provincial Exhibition of 1852 in Brockville. One press account includes a lengthy entry on Medicine Pipe Stem Dance, referring to the “extracts, which we subjoin from Mr Kane’s journal” as a way to “fully explain the picture and superstitions attached to the ceremonial.”3  The entry reads like a detailed ethnological explanation, unlike the comparatively brief account in Wanderings of an Artist. That Kane did not make even a brief reference in his journal to his invitation to this sacred event, combined with the detailed ethnological description in the press review, suggests that Medicine Pipe Stem Dance (both the study and the oil painting) may rely more on descriptions that Kane read than on his own experience."

        "description": "The Buffalo Pound speaks as much to issues of patronage as it does to Kane’s approach to a subject that was of great interest to him. Kane was enthralled with plains bison, and he would execute a number of paintings based on the theme.\r\n          This particular painting, which depicts bison being directed into a corral for slaughter, was one of fourteen produced for Sir George Simpson, governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC), who authorized and aided Kane’s travel through HBC territory. Simpson intended to display the paintings in a room he was designing as a “museum of Indian curiosities”  and seems to have had a vested interest in the images Kane produced for him. Simpson was not shy about directing the artist on subject matter, advising him that the bison should be depicted in profile so as to “give a better idea of the appearance of the animals.”  Kane obliged, but the side view from a distant, elevated vantage point also allowed the artist to better distill the essential elements of the event into a pictorial narrative: the stampeding herd is funnelled by Aboriginal men (on horseback and foot) along a narrowing lane into a corral in which another man, perched in a tree, “chants an invocation for the success of the undertaking.”\r\n          Curiously, Kane’s field journal mentions nothing of his witnessing the actual hunt, just the pound containing the aftermath of a previous slaughter. The artist may well have relied on oral accounts of the event. Kane’s painting is a composite based on several sketches—of bison, figures, landscape—and a detailed pencil drawing that corresponds closely to this particular version."

        "description": "Flat Head Woman and Child, Caw-wacham was one of Kane’s best-known paintings in his day and has proven to be one of his most controversial works. It depicts a woman with an infant whose head is being reshaped; the woman’s own profile highlights the result of the traditional procedure. The image, inspired by Kane’s encounter with the Aboriginal peoples of the Columbia River Valley, is a composite based on separate watercolours of members of two or three different tribes: one Cowlitz (the infant) and the other Songhees or Southern Coast Salish (the woman).1  Kane makes no mention of the reshaping process in his field journal, but it is featured in his book Wanderings of an Artist among the Indians of North America, including the explanation that the “flat” head is a “distinguishing mark of freedom.”2\r\n\r\nWilliam Clark, Heads of Clatsop Indians, from Original Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, 1804–1806 (1905). Clark's drawing shows a child in process of having its head flattened, an old man, a young man, and a woman with shaped heads\r\n          For all the attention and controversy the painting has engendered, it is ironic that Kane depicts the flattening board in the “up” position rather than actually pressuring the child’s skull, as was depicted in more documentary renderings of the procedure, such as a sketch from 1806 by William Clark (1770–1838) of a child in the process of having its head flattened.\r\n          Nineteenth-century responses to Flat Head Woman and Child addressed both aesthetic and ethnographic aspects. When Kane exhibited the painting (titled simply “Sketch of a Chinook”) in the portrait category at the 1852 Upper Canada Provincial Exhibition, it was appreciated as much for the colour of its background landscape as it was as a “trait of Indian customs.”3  Yet interest in its ethnographic references prevailed. The painting no doubt was on display at the Canadian Institute’s March 1855 meeting featuring a reading of Kane’s paper “The Chinook Indians,” which included a description of the reshaping procedure. The reading was complemented by a display of Chinook cultural objects, a skull, and “several admirable oil paintings, executed by Mr. Kane.”4  Flat Head Woman and Child was also the inspiration for an image created by Kane’s friend Daniel Wilson (1816–1892), who reviewed his book Wanderings of an Artist.5  Wilson made his own composite image for the frontispiece to his book Prehistoric Man6  using the same watercolour sketch of a Cowlitz infant and another by Kane of a Clallam woman weaving a basket.7\r\n          Modern commentary is more critical in tone. The art historian Heather Dawkins has approached Flat Head Woman and Child, from a post-colonial perspective, taking Kane to task for his Victorian imperialist viewpoint evident in his disregard for tribal distinctions.8  And, given that Kane painted this “mother and child” theme at a time when Western culture was showing an increased respect toward children, she questions Kane’s motives in depicting this particular Aboriginal custom. Was he simply romanticizing Aboriginal life, or was he intentionally criticizing Aboriginal culture?"

        "description": "If Kane’s documentary impulses were satisfied by drawing from nature freely, or by using a camera lucida, the popularity of the picturesque would nevertheless have encouraged him to approach and view the empirical world in a certain way. Fort Edmonton demonstrates Kane’s use of the picturesque style in which elevated viewpoints and sinuous land formations allow the viewer to “travel” through the image.\r\n\r\nPaul Sandby, Harlech Castle in Merioneth Shire with Snowdon at a Distance, 1776, etching and aquatint in sanguine on ivory laid paper, 23.9 x 31.5 cm (plate); 32 x 46.3 cm (sheet), National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. Sandby (1731–1809) was a well-known practitioner of the picturesque style in England\r\n          Although Kane spent extended periods at Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) posts, there are no pictorial records of the interior of the forts. As the art historian J. Russell Harper notes, the artist’s panoramic views of the company’s presence in the landscape reinforce the sense of its empire.  With its palisades and corner towers, and its situation on a promontory overlooking the North Saskatchewan River, Fort Edmonton must have seemed to Kane the New World equivalent to an Old World castle such as Harlech in North Wales, which is similarly situated on a rock overlooking water. Kane in his early days had copied a print (as yet unidentified) of Harlech Castle.\r\n          Kane made two pencil sketches of the fort as seen from a distance: one from the southeast  and one from the south.  For this oil painting, Kane chose the view from the south, in which the fort is approached by a path running alongside the river. Here Kane was confronted by a scene with two parallel foci: the river extending into the distance on the left and the path culminating in the fort on the right. Kane’s challenge was to resolve the split focus into a picturesque view. This he did by incorporating clouds into the upper left quadrant to create a sweeping “S” that moves the viewer’s eye across the foreground, onto the promontory, creating contact with the horizon and into the sky and distance. \r\n          Current understandings of the picturesque often situate it within the framework of an imperialist ideology. If Fort Edmonton is looked at through this lens, then Kane’s recognition of the economic relationship between empire and colony can also be seen in his inclusion of the fort, the teepees, and the river that was so important to the fur trade—elements included in both his sketches and his preparatory drawings."

        "description": "The Cackabakah Falls1  is a superb example of Kane’s embrace of the sublime. In portraying Kakabeka Falls, the artist has chosen as his subject one of the natural wonders along the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) voyageur route. His depiction of these falls as a fearsome force of nature is intended to inspire and overwhelm the viewer, while the foreground wedge of land offers a stable view at a safe distance.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of an artist using a camera lucida, from the Dictionnaire encyclopédique et biographique de l'industrie et des arts industriels (1882)\r\n          Kane was but a passenger when travelling with the HBC brigades, and while the men portaged, he would sketch. In executing his earlier drawing of this particular view, Kakabeka Falls, 1846, Kane appears to have been aided by an optical instrument. The precise articulation of outline and details of the “tower” in the middle, and the heavier pencil tracing the foliage and rocks in the foreground, suggest Kane used a device called a camera lucida. \r\n          In translating his linear rendition into an oil painting, Kane created a spectacular vision of the sublime. Light glances off the massive sheets of falling water, reflects off the horizontal striations of the chert2  rock, and vies with the storm cloud for supremacy. The diminutive Aboriginal figures on the riverbank are a typical Romantic device used to provide scale and emphasize the immensity of this natural wonder—and, by projection, Kane’s own experience. \r\n          Kane makes no mention of the falls by name in his field journal, nor does he indicate his response to the view; he simply notes that he made sketches of two portages along this leg of his journey.3  It is as though Kane relies on his drawing to accurately record his experience and his painting to emotionally express it."

        "description": "Out of the cycle of one hundred paintings that Kane created, it is this one, Cunnawa-bum, that is used as the frontispiece in his book Wanderings of an Artist among the Indians of North America. Although the image of the young Metis woman of Plains Cree and British ancestry  featured in the book is only one of numerous portraits in the painted cycle, as frontispiece she becomes a sort of cover girl for Kane’s life project. Wanderings of an Artist recounts how the young woman, whom Kane met at Fort Edmonton, held her swan’s-wing fan “in a most coquettish manner”  and that it was her charm that inspired Kane.\r\n          No preliminary portrait sketch or drawing exists of Cunnawa-bum. Kane developed his general concept for a fan portrait through several schematic drawings of a figure holding a fan, sometimes within an oval. One of these drawings is a profile of a “flathead” woman; none are articulated with features that suggest an individual. In the painting the awkwardly disembodied arm implicitly suggests that Kane’s focus was the beguiling fan, underlined by its trompe l’oeil nudge into the viewer’s space.\r\n          This strangely generic aspect of the portrait, despite its connection to an individual, is carried over into its life as the chromolithograph frontispiece to Wanderings of an Artist where its title becomes the anonymous Portrait of a Half-Breed Cree Girl. According to the ethnologist Daniel Wilson (1816–1892), a friend of Kane’s who reviewed Wanderings of an Artist, the oil captures the racial duality of the sitter; Wilson writes that Kane’s painting “presents an exceedingly interesting illustration of the blending of the white and Indian features in the female Half-breed.” Wilson is criticizing the work of the chromolithographer, Vincent Brooks, who had “sacrificed every trace of Indian features in his desire to produce his own ideal of a pretty face, such as might equally well have been copied for an ordinary wax doll.”\r\n          For the artist, ethnographer, and lithographer, respectively, the essence of Cunnawa-bum’s charm was presented as a fan, in her identity as a half-breed, and as a wax doll. It is perhaps in Cunnawa-bum’s best interest that modern viewers shift the focus to the meaning of her name—“One That Looks at the Stars”—as a way to subvert the nineteenth-century male gaze and recognize her as empowered."

        "description": "The Constant Sky projects the quintessential Romantic ideal that equates pristine nature with “primitive man.”  An Aboriginal woman, The Constant Sky, sitting on an animal skin, leans against a tree trunk, her child by her side. The massive tree, with its intertwining branches, vines, and protective leaf canopy, suggests an ancient and unspoiled landscape. It is an idyllic locale, where a mirror-like river and the modest waterfall suggest the calm and comforting sounds of nature that reassure The Constant Sky of her way of life. For all the assumptions made during Kane’s time about the Aboriginal people being a “vanishing race,” one wonders if Kane’s image is meant to be an affirmation of the permanence of the Aboriginal presence. Seen from a nineteenth-century perspective, the early morning light in this painting alludes to the future, underscoring the idea of continuity that is implicit in both the woman’s name and the presence of the child.\r\n          Kane may have drawn on several different personal experiences to create this painting; he apparently relied on sketches of landscapes, figures, and cultural objects from different regions and tribes.  Ultimately Kane’s random borrowing from his own field sketches is moot, as his goal was to transcend the particular and capture an essential moral truth. Kane’s Arcadian landscape, framed by a painted, decorative arch of gold, offers a meditation on the ideal communion between humankind and nature, which at the time was thought to be manifest in the lives of the Aboriginal people."

        "description": "The Death of Omoxesisixany or Big Snake is a chromolithograph after Paul Kane’s painting of the same title, the only Kane painting to be mass-produced and marketed as a stand-alone print for framing.1  It was printed and published in Toronto in 1860 and no doubt underwritten by his patron, George William Allan. The subject matter was likely chosen by Allan, who seems to have considered the original painting one of Kane’s best, and its treatment points to an assumption of the urban audience’s interest in theatrical “exoticism.”\r\n          The subject is the death of the Blackfoot chief at the hands of a Cree warrior, an event Kane imagined, based on hearsay.2  There are no known preparatory drawings, but the brown horse’s headstall and the Cree warrior’s shoulder bag depicted in the image were inspired by items Kane had collected.3  One can imagine Kane in his studio, relying both on reproductions of European paintings—such as The Start of the Race of the Riderless Horses, c. 1820, by Horace Vernet (1789–1863)—and on his own collection of Aboriginal artifacts to create this striking painting of Canadian history. \r\n          The chromolithograph is remarkable for the degree to which it corresponds to the original painting in spatial relationships and in detail. It is doubtful, however, that Kane himself was actively involved in the lithographic process. The printers have been identified as Charles Fuller and Hermann Bencke, a Prussian immigrant. Fuller and Bencke’s superb workmanship is evident both in the embossed surface that creates texture and depth and in the extensive number of colours used; as a testament to this workmanship, the chromolithograph has been used as a reliable reference for the conservation of the original painting."
