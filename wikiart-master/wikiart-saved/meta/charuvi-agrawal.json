        "description": "People's revolution:\nhttps://vimeo.com/205052363\nInteractive Installation \nJayaprakash Narayan Museum \nLucknow (2016) , 7 x 15 feet\n\nCharuvi Agrawal Presents A Tour De Force For The JayprakashNarayan Museum In Lucknow – “Thali Bajao Praxinoscope  – The Peoples Revolution”\n \nJean Baudrillard said that the simulacra shows the truth that there is none. A revolution sounds life changing, defining the pages of history and is the culmination of efforts for a cause. Charuvi’s Thali Bajao revolving praxinoscope attempts to recreate the flash in history which is the ‘Maut Ka Ghanta’, Jayprakash Narayans revolution tactic employed immediately post Indira Gandhi’s declaration of emergency in 1975. In that flash, at exactly 9 pm each night, the revolutionaries came out to make a horrendous din using utensils and common metalwares, to remind Mrs. Gandhi, that ‘Total Revolution’ is coming. \nThe 8 foot tall revolving sculpture was made using clay, fiberglass, metal, plaster, acrylic over 11 weeks in a makeshift workshop. At a glance, the artwork shows layers of cylindrical homes stacked on each other with commoners lining the burnt umber coloured streets. Kept on a rotating platform and with perfectly calibrated strobe lights the sculpture is designed to take you into the true essence of what it is. \nOnce the sculpture starts it’s rotations, the strobe lights and unique geometry of the artwork create a praxinoscopic illusion of reality. The sculpture itself and each and every uniquely designed and hand-painted  figurine comes alive, enveloping the viewer into that era, bringing that energy and fear which was what the revolutionary wanted each one to feel. It transports you alongside the youth, pedestrians and luminaries in Patna and lets you feel the true pulse of Bihar, two generations ago. \nBlending art and technology, Charuvi creates yet another emotionally stimulating project which truly transcends into a living spectacle. Her passion to entice the viewer in rapture and awe can be seen with this marvelous execution of an extremely complex artwork."

Ghungroos are used to evoke optimism through a medium that is universally known for its positive vibe: music. Kaivalya was created with the intention to emit a rhythmic sound of the legendary Gajendra Stuti (hymn sung by Gajendra in praise of the lord), thus heightening the experience of viewing the installation."
