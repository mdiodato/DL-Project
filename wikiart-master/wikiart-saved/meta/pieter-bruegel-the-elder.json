        "description": "In 1551 or 1552 Bruegel set off on the customary northern artist’s journey to Italy, probably by way of France. From several extant paintings, drawings, and etchings, it can be deduced that he traveled beyond Naples to Sicily, possibly as far as Palermo, and that in 1553 he lived for some time in Rome, where he worked with a celebrated miniaturist, [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/giulio-clovio]Giulio Clovio[/url], an artist greatly influenced by [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo]Michelangelo[/url] and later a patron of the young [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco]El Greco[/url]. The inventory of Clovio’s estate shows that he owned a number of paintings and drawings by Bruegel as well as a miniature done by the two artists in collaboration. It was in Rome in 1553 that Bruegel produced his earliest signed and dated painting, 'Landscape with Christ and the Apostles at the Sea of Tiberias'. The holy figures in this painting were probably done by [url=https://www.wikiart.org/en/maarten-de-vos]Maarten de Vos[/url], a painter from Antwerp then working in Italy."

The juxtaposition is meant to illustrate the two sides of human nature: pleasure and religious chastity, and the contrast between the two. Near the church sit well-behaved children. Near the inn are rambunctious drunkards. The fat man in the middle of the painting, with the pie on his head, is a representation of “carnival.” The painting represents a common theme in 16th century Europe, the battle between Carnival and Lent, and with its humor and witticism, is a satirical critique on the conflicts of the Reformation.

Although other artists and authors had produced paintings and books on proverbs, this painting is considered to be the first large-scale rendition of the theme. The proverbs, of which there are over 100, as well as the early titles, are meant to illustrate human stupidity and foolishness. The painting was so popular that Pieter Brueghel the Younger reproduced up to twenty copies of it, many of which included various renditions on the proverbs. "

It is in oils whereas Bruegel's other paintings on canvas are in tempera.\n\nThough the world landscape, a type of work with the title subject represented by small figures in the distance, was an established type in Early Netherlandish painting, pioneered by Joachim Patiner, to have a much larger unrelated \"genre\" figure in the foreground is original and represents something of a blow against the emerging hierarchy of genres. Other landscapes by Bruegel, for example The Hunters in the Snow (1565) and others in that series of paintings showing the seasons, show genre figures in a raised foreground, but not so large relative to the size of the image, nor with a subject from a \"higher\" class of painting in the background."

His moral is that in the mind of God children's games possess as much significance as the activities of their parents. This idea was a familiar one in contemporary literature: in an anonymous Flemish poem published in Antwerp in 1530 by Jan van Doesborch, mankind is compared to children who are entirely absorbed in their foolish games and concerns."

Only once did Bruegel taken up the etching needle himself, for this Hare Hunt."

The monkey on the left signifies avarice; the monkey on the right, prodigality, a conclusion based on an analysis of Bruegel's unusual composition (with its polarized and contrasted figures), a comparison with other 16th-century compositions depicting monkeys, and the observation that the Two Monkeys has a fundamental resemblance to another Bruegel painting, the Dulle Griet (Mad Meg). The similarity between these two works and the contextual evidence (the art, literature, and pageantry of the period) support the view that Bruegel's subject was the improper use of wealth — a central issue for humanist Christians in the Low Countries in the 1560's."

As with most of his subjects taken from the Bible, Bruegel treats Saul's suicide as a contemporary event, showing the armies in 16th century armour.\n\nThe Suicide of Saul is an early attempt by Bruegel to reconcile landscape and figure painting. If it is compared with one of his latest works, The Magpie on the Gallows of 1568, its weaknesses are apparent: the foreground and background are not yet reconciled and the jutting outcrop of rock in the centresee 2nd detail is a mannerist device which one may see again in The Procession to Calvary. However, the distant landscape is seen through a shimmering haze, which seems to have the effect of emphasizing the foreground detail, and this does represent a new stage in the evolution of Bruegel's depiction of naturalistic landscape."

In Renaissance theory of art, the correct rendering of facial expressions was an important artistic requirement. Before this, Bruegel experts tried to interpret the yawning face as an allegory for Sloth. This sin was generally considered as “the Devil’s pillow”. The sort of work ethic which is portrayed by this expression was far from a foreign concept for the pre-capitalist middle-class society of the 16th century. Art from this time uses satirical images of beggars and other types of people who did not earn their money from working. \nThe fact that a country man is depicted yawning is doubtless not by chance: the urban middle classes wished to set themselves apart from this vulgar behaviour practiced by peasants and country folk. Yawning, and particularly showing ones teeth whilst doing so was considered as rude."

Brueghel casts the entire work in a reddish-brown tone that gives the scene an infernal aspect appropriate for the subject at hand. The profusion of scenes and moralizing sense applied by the artists are part of Hieronymous Bosch´s influence on this work. Bruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These are his native tradition of Northern woodcuts of the Dance of Death and the Italian conception of the Triumph of Death, as in frescoes he would have seen in the Palazzo Sclafani in Palermo and in the Camposanto Monumentale at Pisa."

For Bruegel the composition is unusually traditional. Perhaps because he was treating such a solemn religious event, he adopted a well-known scheme. Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of mannerist painting, as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them."

Griet was a disparaging name given to any bad-tempered, shrewish woman. Her mission refers to the Flemish proverb:'She could plunder in front of hell and return unscathed'.\nBruegel is thus making fun of noisy, aggressive women. At the same time he castigates the sin of covetousness: although already burdened down with possessions, Griet and her grotesque companions are prepared to storm the mouth of Hell itself in their search for more"

The work is composed from a high viewpoint, focusing attention on the Infant Christ on his mother's lap, at the exact centre of the picture. People crowd around them and there is little sense of depth or space. The elongated figures of the Kings are characteristic of a painting style that was fashionable around this time.\n\nA figure on the extreme right wears spectacles. His presence may indicate that those around Christ are blind to his significance; Bruegel has used spectacles on other occasions to signify in an ironic manner the inability of the subject to see the truth. Most of the figures, in fact, appear to be gently mocked by the artist.\n\nIt is uncommon for soldiers to be included in a depiction of the Adoration. As in other works by Bruegel, their presence may reflect the Spanish occupation of the Netherlands at this time."

Later it belonged to Rubens.\n\nBruegel's interpretation of the scene is unusual in the exceptionally large numbers of the just who crowd around the Virgin's deathbed. The literary source for this is Jacobus de Voragine's Golden Legend, which tells of numerous holy persons being present when Mary was reunited with her son.\n\nJohn the disciple, sleeping next to the fireplace on the left of the picture, is dreaming that the apostles and other saints have assembled around the bed of the dying Virgin. Bruegel is employing seemingly supernatural lighting effects here, such as would later be typical of Rembrandt's work."

The four other paintings of the group are the Gloomy Day, Hunters in the Snow, and the Return of the Herd (all Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), and Haymaking (Lobkowicz Collections, Prague). \n Although \"16 pieces\" by the artist are listed in Jongelinck's 1566 inventory, only two independent works and the Twelff maenden (twelve months) are mentioned by name, suggesting that the series may originally have included twelve paintings. By 1595, however, when the panels were purchased by the city of Antwerp and presented as a gift to Archduke Ernst, they are described as six paintings representing the twelve months. Although the original number of panels remains an open question, most scholars now believe there were only six panels, as scenes that would traditionally have appeared in two separate months in contemporary Calendar series (a theme common in illuminated manuscripts) are included in a single image. This panel is usually identified as representing July–August, or late summer.\nBruegel's drawing Spring (Albertina, Vienna) is inscribed by the artist \"De Lenten Meert April Meij,\" and may resemble in subject the missing panel of the months that presumably represented April-May or early spring."

Scientists have used his portrayal of the wintry scene to corroborate evidence on the severity of the Little Ice Age, during which the painting was created. Also created during a time of religious revolution in the Netherlands, Brueghel is giving us a secular illustration of what country life should look like. "

        "description": "The Return of the Herd is one of a cycle depicting the months, five paintings of which have survived. This picture presumably depicts November.\n\nMany of Bruegel's paintings show people not so much as the masters of nature but rather as a part of it: there is hardly any difference here between the coloration of the cattle and that of their drovers.\n\nNovember is the month in which the cattle return to their winter quarters from the summer pastures and Bruegel shows them being driven towards the hill-top village. In this panel Bruegel's remarkable technique can be studied at its best. Individual forms are built up with the greatest economy. Within the sketched outline the paint is laid on thinly, sometimes with an almost dry brush. The light brown gesso underpainting is allowed to show through, in this instance giving a warm brown tone to the whole foreground. Bruegel must have composed the Months largely on the panels themselves; only one preparatory drawing on paper survives, a study for one of the hunters in The Hunters in the Snow, the January panel. Having prepared the panel, Bruegel drew the outlines of the composition in paint with a thin brush and then added the thinly-scraped areas of colour within those outlines."
