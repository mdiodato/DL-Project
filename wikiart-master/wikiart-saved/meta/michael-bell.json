        "description": "In \"Ticket to Ride\" Michael Bell created a cinematic painting series as a journey through one woman’s harrowing search for redemption, only nothing inspires redemption quite like revenge.\r\n\r\n\"The Transfer\" is the first of nine large-format mixed-media paintings that range from emotionally-driven portraits as allegories reminiscent of dramatic film-stills to dark, ambiguous hotel room scenes and metropolitan landscapes on 60\" X 60\" canvases overlaid with mixed-media subway maps painted into the background of each work. Bell’s narrative strategy is for the viewer to question how much of Ticket to Ride is just a dream, and how much is rooted in reality. Its major movement is the journey taken by an Italian Femme Fetale that begins on a New York City subway platform in Scene 1, \"The Transfer\" as she awaits her metaphorical “train” and her journey continues -- painting by painting -- like a roller coaster ride through her mind."
