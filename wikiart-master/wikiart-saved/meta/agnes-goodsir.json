        "description": "Paris was the place to be in the 1920s. This was especially true for adventurous artists, writers and performers, who flocked to this âCity of lightâ in the years following the First World War. Goodsir, an Australian by birth, had come to know Paris well. At the time of painting The Parisienne she was living in an apartment at 18 rue lâOdÃ©on in Montparnasse. Sylvia Beach (1887â1962), the renowned American who established the English-language bookshop Shakespeare and Company in Paris and first published James Joyceâs Ulysses, lived in the same apartment block with her partner Adrienne Monnier (1892â1955). The sitter in The Parisienne is another American, Goodsirâs close companion Rachel Dunn, nicknamed Cherry. She had divorced and moved to Paris to be with Goodsir. The combination of propriety and a sense of adventure was integral to their lives in Paris, as it is to this gently seductive portrait.\n\nCherry sat for numerous portraits by Goodsir, although many of them are more conventionally feminine and more domestic in their settings. Here Goodsir captures a sense of Parisian style, combining theatricality with elegant restraint. The sitter is placed against a muted cream background and her garments are simplified in shape and colour, giving strength to the composition. The tonal palette and delicately modulated forms recall Goodsirâs early training in contrast with modernist practices at the time. Yet a more subtle feeling of modernity pervades the sitter. Stylishly dressed in a high collared jacket with a contemporary flapperâs cloche hat she is casually holding a cigarette (perhaps the brand known as the Parisienne![1]). Smoking was considered a sign of emancipation and the rather masculine style of dress epitomised modernity in the streets, cafes, bars and theatres of the Latin Quarter in the 1920s. The sitterâs eyes are in shadow, adding to the sense of mystery, while her lips are bright cherry red. Her hands are relaxed with each bearing the glint of a ring, perhaps indicating past and present lives.\n\nWhen Goodsir visited Australia on Valentineâs Day, 1927, she was hailed as âa portrait painter of international reputeâ.[2] Apart from Cherry, Goodsir painted numerous famous and well-connected people including Leo Tolstoy and Banjo Paterson. Yet her portraits and likenesses of Cherry are, by and large, her most intimate and confident works. Goodsir returned to Paris for good later in 1927. It was where her heart resided; she too had become a Parisienne.\n\nDeborah Hart\n\nhttps://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=169716"

        "description": "This is a portrait of Rachel Dunn, the artist's long-term companion and the subject of numerous works from Goodsir's second Paris period. Wearing a boldly patterned shawl over a pullover, her outfit accessorized by a hat and fan, and with a cigarette in her hand, Cherry, as she was referred to by Goodsir, typifies the 1920s flapper - confident and independent in demeanour, relaxed and comfortable within the cafe environment."
