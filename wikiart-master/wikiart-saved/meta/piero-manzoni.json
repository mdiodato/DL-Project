        "description": "Like a number of his contemporaries, Manzoni wanted to banish narrative content from painting. For Manzoni, this meant removing even colour from his works. In 1957, he began to produce the achromes, which he described as ‘a single uninterrupted and continuous surface from which anything superfluous and all interpretative possibilities are excluded.’ He began by soaking his canvases in kaolin, a soft china clay used in making porcelain. The kaolin eliminated colour to the point of his desired ‘nothingness’. The weight of the material caused it to sag, creating folds across the surface of the canvas."

        "description": "Both a response to and an extension of the Spatialist explorations of Lucio Fontana, Alberto Burri's self-asserting material works and the immateriality and mysticism of Yves Klein's monochromes, Manzoni Achromes were self-defining works of art that asserted only their own surfaces - surfaces from which all other extraneous detail, artifice and style had been eliminated. Described by Manzoni, who was greatly inspired by the psychoanalytical writings of Freud and Jung at this time, as 'totems', his Achromes were essentially non-pictures - demonstrably real material presences that articulated only their own formal and material properties. In this, they were works that finally, and irreparably, broke down the illusive and conceptual space that up until this point had always traditionally surrounded the picture plane. At the same time, they were works of art that began to operate as real, unaesthetic concepts within the real, physical space of the viewer and the world around them. Marking the beginning of a process of integration between art and life, the Achrome was therefore, a work that signaled the end of the idea of the art-object, and in this respect, represented the culmination of the anti-material tendency embodied in Fontana's Spatialist aesthetic and also the 'immateriality' of Klein's work. Going beyond these earlier precedents, the Achromes were works that defined what Manzoni saw as an ultimate 'zone' of freedom and the final liberation of art from style. 'We absolutely cannot consider the picture as a space onto which to project our mental scenography' Manzoni insisted. 'It is the arena of freedom in which we search for the discovery of our first images. Images which are as absolute as possible, which cannot be valued for that which they record, explain or express, but only for that which they are.' (Piero Manzoni, For the Discovery of a Zone of Images. 1957.)\r\n\r\nFor an artist who insisted on the liberation of art from style however, Manzoni's uniquely 'styleless' creations nevertheless often betray the artist's own magnificent and unerring sense of style. The Achromes of 1957-58 and 1958-59 here for example, are two very different manifestations of the same autonomous and self-defining, 'styleless' concept. While one, with its tight, serially-repeated kaolin-coated pleats forms a dramatic line of self-asserting material texture across the centre of the otherwise flat white canvas in a manner that anticipates the simplicity of much Minimalist art, the loose, informel-like folds of the other, slightly earlier Achrome seem to embrace a sumptuous Baroquelike eloquence. The quiet, innate and sober elegance of both these works also permeates many of Manzoni's creations even as they gradually progressed away from materiality and almost any intervention by the artist's hand altogether and eventually transcended the objecthood of art entirely to become mere gestures and/or concepts. From the endless linee (lines), his thumb-printed series of eggs, balloons of his own breath and even mass-produced tins of 'merda d'artista' (his own shit) to ever more expansive and open creations such as the signing of people as living artworks or his 'socle du monde' (a simple pedestal that transformed the entire world into a ready-made work of art), the cool elegance of Manzoni's understated 'style' remained visible within all his work."

        "description": "\"Corpo d'aria\" (\"Body of Air\"; plural \"Corpi d'aria\") is an \"artist's multiple\" by the Italian artist Piero Manzoni. Manufactured between October 1959 and March 1960, the pieces comprise of a box, a tripod base, deflated balloon and a mouthpiece. 45 copies were made and sold at 30,000 lire each. Originally, any buyer could ask Manzoni to inflate the balloon himself, but would be charged an extra Deutschmark for every litre of air expanded. When fully expanded, the balloons measured 80 cm in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe \"Corpi d'aria\" were first exhibited at the Galleria Azimut, run by Manzoni and his friend, the Italian artist Enrico Castellani, from May 3 to May 9, 1960. Manzoni organised an elaborate photo shoot and a short film to publicise the event. He was to write later in the year that the bodies had sold well.\r\n\r\nBy making a purely transient work, that would deflate before the buyer’s eyes, Manzoni was parodying the traditional sculptural emphasis on permanence and mocking the traditional emphasis on the artist’s creative force. He was also using modern materials to suggest an aggressively modern aesthetic whilst creating a poetic metaphor for the transience of life itself."

        "description": "Artist's Shit (Italian: \"Merda d'artista\") is a 1961 artwork by the Italian artist Piero Manzoni. The work consists of 90 tin cans, each 30 grams and measuring 4.8x6.5cm, with a label in Italian, English, French, and German stating:\r\n\r\n    Artist's Shit\r\n    Contents 30 gr net\r\n    Freshly preserved\r\n    Produced and tinned\r\n    in May 1961\r\n\r\nAt the time the piece was created Manzoni was producing works that explored the relationship between art production and human production, Artist's Breath (\"Fiato d'artista\"), a series of balloons filled with Manzoni's breath, being an example.\r\n\r\nA tin was sold for €124,000 at Sotheby's on May 23 2007; in October 2008 tin 083 was offered for sale at Sotheby's with an estimate of £50-70,000. It sold for £97,250. The cans were originally to be valued according to their equivalent weight in gold — $37 each in 1961 — with the price fluctuating according to the market.\r\n\r\nOne of Manzoni's collaborators, Agostino Bonalumi, claimed that the tins are full not of faeces but plaster; in contrast Manzoni's girlfriend Nanda Vigo, who helped him produce the cans, claimed the contents really were faeces. Vigo's assertion is disputed by Manzoni's brother and sister. An art dealer from the Gallery Blu in Milan claims to have detected a fecal odour emanating from a can.\r\n\r\nThe piece received media coverage due to a lawsuit in the mid-1990's, when an art museum in Randers, Denmark was accused by art collector John Hunov of causing leakage of a can which had been on display at the museum in 1994. Allegedly, the museum had stored the can at irresponsibly warm temperatures. The lawsuit ended with the museum paying a DKK 250,000 settlement to the collector."

        "description": "Manzoni considered the two-dimensional surface of painting and drawing not as something “to be filled with colors and forms” but as a place “of unlimited possibilities” in which a line could exist “beyond all problems of composition and size,” he wrote. The line in this work is more than half a mile long, but in theory, Manzoni believed, such a line could stretch to infinity. One of many similar drawings by the artist, Linea m 1000 is invisible, contained in a generic canister; in this way the work anticipated the Conceptual art of the 1960s, in which the idea—in this case, line—was more important than the form of the artwork."
