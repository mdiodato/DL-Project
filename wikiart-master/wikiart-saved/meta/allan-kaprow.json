The only coherent and ordered element in the composition is in the formal arrangement of the elements into vertical strips. Kaprow produced the work in a frenzied, ritualistic process, influenced by the gestural quality of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock]Pollock[/url]'s action painting. Kaprow echoes the \"combines\" of [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-rauschenberg]Robert Rauschenberg[/url] in his synthesis of Pollock's technique with Cage's influence. Kaprow had moved toward an \"unbound,\" three dimensional form, and was increasingly using found objects and everyday materials in an attempt to reconcile art with everyday experience, which would end up being his ultimate goal."

Kaprow began to investigate the effect on space through the incorporation of three-dimensional and found objects into his work. Each time [i]Rearrangeable Panels[/i] was exhibited, the curator or artist would be forced to make choices about how to configure the panels, foreshadowing Kaprow's use of audience participation. Kaprow challenges the notion of artistic authorship through this collaborative element of construction and in its unique response to each site in which it is placed."

In this seminal work he recreated a junkyard, in the then Martha Jackson Gallery's backyard, creating an immersive environment with which the audience interacted. This work contained a high element of play, but within the boundaries Kaprow had prefixed. The piece illustrates sculpture's expansion in scale and the increasingly blurred boundaries between a \"life like\" and an \"art like\" art. In Kaprow's determination, there was no distinction between the viewer and the artwork; the viewer became part of the piece."

        "description": "[i]Words[/i], exhibited at the Smolin Gallery in New York in 1962, takes the audience on a journey through two rooms, encouraging them to contribute to written and verbal components as they progress. Through this interactive environment, Kaprow denotes \"urban text\" referencing graffiti, billboards, newspapers, overheard conversations, and a lecture, engaging the viewer in a multi-sensory experience that literally brings \"words\" to life. The importance of this piece is based in the responsibility of the viewer to become part of the creative process beyond passive involvement.\n\n[i]by [url href=https://www.theartstory.org/artist-kaprow-allan-artworks.htm#pnt_5]The Art Story Foundation[/url][/i]"

Kaprow used music theory with new developments in electronic music, theatre, and dance, all combined within a pioneering structure that demanded participatory involvement. [i]18 Happenings in 6 Parts[/i] was performed at the Reuben Gallery in New York and is one of his earliest and most important Happenings, often cited as a turning point for performance art. Kaprow authorized a reinvention of this piece just a few weeks before his death and it was performed in Munich's Haus der Kunst in November of 2006."

        "description": "[i]Fluids[/i] is one of Kaprow's most ambitious works. In it, he recruited groups of local residents to build huge ice structures in various locations in Pasadena, CA during a mid career retrospective. The original \"score\" for the piece was displayed on billboards around the city. The idea of collective action resulting in the inevitable melting of the ice was a comment on the obsolete nature of human labor - a \"dystopian allegory of capitalist production and consumption,\" refuting the permanence of the art object. Documentation of the event includes photographs, film, the billboard score, the artist's notes and drawings, letters and press clippings. This seminal work was reinvented in 2005 and as Overflow by the LA Art Girls in 2008 as part of [i]Allan Kaprow - Art as Life[/i] posthumous retrospective at the Geffen Contemporary's space in LA MOCA."

        "description": "Kaprow produced the extended piece, [i]Trading Dirt[/i], when studying at the Zen Center of San Diego. He began by trading the soil in his garden for the \"Buddhist dirt\" of the center. This was then traded with various types of dirt collected by Kaprow. This sequence of events went on sporadically for three years, each exchange accompanied by an anecdote, recorded on film. Kaprow presents dirt as a metaphor that only gains meaning as it is exchanged or \"traded.\" This occurred in 1983, long after Kaprow had replaced the Happening with the Activity. The work integrates storytelling with playful humour and illustrates a shift tow[i]ard a more private, intimate participatory exchange. A film, Trading Dirt with Simon Rodia and Allan Kaprow[/i] by Rosie Lee Hooks and Paul S. Rogers, was created for the [i]Allan Kaprow: Art as Life[/i] exhibition at MOCA Geffen Contemporary in Spring 2008 in addition to a reinvention of the piece."
