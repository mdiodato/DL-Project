Is it possible that, by being immersed in the drunkenness of the immediate satisfaction that this world offers, we rather look more comfortably at the reflection?\r\n\r\nThe wish that the passing and unreal shines never cloud the authentic meaning of things is, without any doubt, what drives me to paint “Shopping” …. in the meantime the sun is shining out there.\r\n\r\nThis oil painting is done on gallery wrapped linen canvas, with no need for framing, as the edges are painted. Ready to hang. It comes with a Certificate of Authenticity signed by the artist. "
