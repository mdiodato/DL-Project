        "description": "Roni Horn's work is a continuation of some of the formal arguments of American Minimal art. Her concentrated, simple forms and the conception of sculpture aligned to a specific space echo such artists as Judd and Andre. However, the artist's use of language and metaphor distinguishes her work and emphasises a connection with the structures of poetry. Here, Horn uses a pair of polished aluminium rectangles and bright yellow plastic to make tangible William Blake's 'Tyger Tyger burning bright' from 'Songs of Innocence and Experience'. The poem reflects on the breadth of the act of creation and marvels at the awesome inspiration of the creator: 'What immortal hand or eye/Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?'"

        "description": "Since 1989, Horn frequently has embedded texts in her sculptures. In this work, the top edges of letters can be seen on two sides of an aluminium slab. At first glance they resemble the calibrated forms of universal bar codes. When the viewer walks around the work the phrase 'to see a landscape as it is when I am not there' becomes legible. The line is from 'Gravity and Grace' by the French writer Simone Weil. Horn uses the phrase to remind us to look carefully at what we see, and to try to perceive the world without the filter of cultural preconceptions that may distort our vision."

        "description": "Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) is a series of fifteen large photo-lithographs of water, printed on white paper. Each of the images focuses on a small area of the surface of the river Thames. The colour and texture of these watery surfaces varies dramatically between images: colours range from black to blue and from dark green to khaki-yellow, and in each case the water’s texture is differently augmented by tidal movement and the play of light. Close inspection of the images reveals that tiny numbers in typeface are dotted like specks of flotsam over the water’s surface. These numbers refer to footnotes printed along the lower edge of each image’s white border. The footnotes present a series of musings and quotations on the significance of the river and the moods and narratives it evokes. Tate’s Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) is from an edition of seven.\r\n\r\nThe series Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) is one of three similar projects dating from 1999–2000 in which Horn used photographs of the water of the Thames. These prints are part of a larger public arts project involving a group of artists commissioned by the Public Arts Development Trust in London and Minetta Brook in New York to produce new works connected with the Thames and Hudson waterfronts. For her three Thames projects, Horn focused only on the stretch of the river that runs through the heart of London, because of its centrality to the daily life of the city (‘Roni Horn Interview: Water’ [n.p.].) Another Water (2000) is an artist’s book that explores the surface of the river with photographs taken over the period of a year. As with Still Water, each photograph is footnoted. Some Thames 2000 for the University of Akureyri, Iceland, is a permanent installation of some eighty photographs of water displayed in the university’s public spaces, thus echoing the flow of human traffic through the institution. Horn’s works that focus on the textures of water are driven in part by the artist’s fascination with the changeability of the Thames as a tidal river. She explains: \"The Thames has this incredible moodiness, and that’s what the camera picks up. [I]t has these vertical changes and it moves very quickly. It’s actually a very dangerous river and you sense that just by looking at it ... [E]very photograph is wildly different – even though you could be photographing the same thing from one minute to the next. It’s almost got the complexity of a portrait.\" (Quoted in ‘Roni Horn Interview: Water’ [n.p.].)\r\n\r\nThe compelling quality of water to inspire contemplation and fear, and the diverse meanings and references invoked by its textures and depths, are significant themes in the Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) images. Contemplation is made more pronounced by the use of the footnotes which encourage the viewer to concentrate on different parts of the water’s surface. The text of the footnotes, while appearing strictly ordered according to the numbering system, is presented in a loose, fragmentary, stream of consciousness style. It seems that the viewer is encouraged to listen in on a conversation between the artist and herself. Some footnotes relate anecdotes connected with the Thames, particularly concerning incidences of suicide involving the river. Interspersing these observations are references to films and songs, and to literary sources including novels by Joseph Conrad (1857–1924), Charles Dickens (1812–70) and William Faulkner (1897–1962), and the poetry of Emily Dickinson (1830–86), whose works have inspired Horn elsewhere, such as in the installation Key and Cue, No. 1755 (reproduced in Roni Horn aka Roni Horn catalogue volume, pp.90–1.) The purpose of each footnote is to articulate a point of connection between viewer and image. In P13059, footnote 22, Horn describes this connection: \"This footnote (and all the others) gives confluence to this spot on the paper ... to this undulation in the water, to this greenish color of ink deployed to image the water, to the idea of water, all water, to the sensual surface of this paper, to the moment when you happened upon this number, and to you in that moment.\""

        "description": "The materiality of objects and the formal conditions of their physical placement are primary concerns in Horn’s work. She is known predominantly for her sculpture and photography, but drawing has been a major part of her practice for the past twenty years. The artist’s engagement with the medium of drawing is such that she has said, ‘If you were to ask me what I do, I would say that I draw. That is the primary activity and all my work has it in common, regardless of idiom or material’ (Roni Horn, quoted in Paulo Herkenhoff, ‘What Is Drawing for Roni Horn?’ in Roni Horn: Drawings, exhibition catalogue, Galerie d’Art Graphique, Centre Pompidou, Paris, 2003, p.27).\r\n\r\nWere 12 is one of a series of drawings in which pure pigment is applied directly to paper. In a meticulous process that can take several months Horn begins by fixing rich red pigment to paper with successive brushings of varnish, creating a dense, rough surface. She then cuts the pigmented paper into strips or small geometric shapes. These segments are joined edge to edge with plain paper to create complex and delicate assemblages. The sculptural construction of the drawings is precise; the pieces of paper do not overlap but are carefully juxtaposed. The exact arrangement of the pieces of plain and pigmented paper demonstrates Horn’s sculptural approach to assemblage and her ongoing formal investigation of placement.\r\n\r\nHorn began making drawings in this way in the mid-1980s. Over time they have become larger and more formally complex. In Were 12 the sophisticated composition of curvilinear and geometric shapes suggests the outline of flowers. The two distinct forms in the drawing exist in a complementary dialogue and recall the motif of doubling in Horn’s sculptural installations. Jonas Storsve has described the sensual effect of repeated forms in Horn’s drawings. He has written, ‘The connection between two forms, that is one of the leading strands of [Horn’s] work, can be taken as a simple transcription of sensuality which is also present in the very tactile handling of the materials’ (Storsve, ‘Introduction’, Roni Horn: Drawings, p.14).\r\n\r\nThe work’s title suggests Horn’s interest in language and semantics. Dieter Schwarz has argued that the titles of Horn’s drawings suggest interrelation, saying: ‘[T]he titles ... have in common that they cannot stand independently, but require syntactic completion ... These titles emphasise the incompleteness of each individual element of a drawing, which does not exist independently, but refers to one alongside’ (Schwarz, ‘Just Doubles This The Distant Doubles Must As &amp; others’, in Roni Horn: Rare Spellings, exhibition catalogue, Kunstmuseum Winterthur, 1993, p.116). Other pigment drawings by the artist bear titles including Just, Could, So and Too. Like Were, these are simple words whose brevity belies the range of their possible meanings."
