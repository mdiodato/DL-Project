        "description": "The attention to colour in this early still life by Heron reflects his enthusiasm for the work of Bonnard and Matisse. He commented that 'throughout my early life I had this tremendous battle against the total English contempt for anything they could call decorative ¿ The perfectly ordered surface gives great pleasure. That pleasure used to be run away from by the English'. The ceramics depicted in this work were produced by the Leach pottery, where Heron worked during the Second World War."

        "description": "Heron painted this picture, inspired by his garden in West Penwith, Cornwall, during a period when he saw himself moving from representational art to abstraction. He recalled: ‘I referred to the series as garden paintings, since they certainly related in my mind to the extraordinary effervescence of flowering azaleas and camellias which was erupting all over the garden.’ Amongst the older generation of British artists, Heron admired Hitchens for his ability to create the illusion of space through colour. In 1953, Heron organised an exhibition entitled ‘Space in Colour’ at the Hanover Gallery that included works by Hitchens, Lanyon and himself."

        "description": "Red Garden is among the earliest known prints by Patrick Heron and reflects a critical moment of change in his work. It is thought to have been made at Bath Academy of Art at Corsham Court, Somerset, under the supervision of Henry Cliffe the principal lecturer in lithography. Heron had previously made monotypes and designed scarves for Cresta Silks, but this may have been his first editioned print. It was produced in at least one other colour, yellow having been substituted for the red.\r\n\r\nIn 1956 Heron began to make what appeared to be non-representational paintings, in defiance of his earlier advocacy of representation. In the same year, he settled in his new home, Eagles Nest, Zennor, above the coast of west Cornwall. The two events converged as the paintings of that year were, despite their abstract appearance, associated with the garden there. In January 1956 the artist made the first of a series of works associated with Eagles Nest's garden - Vertical: January 1956. These are made up of layers of dabs or short strokes of paint, often thin enough for the medium to dribble down the canvas. The deployment of the marks ranges from a relatively rigid structure of vertical strokes to a looser, less evenly dispersed series of short stabs of paint, as in Azalea Garden: May 1956. In some, calligraphic lines of oil paint are drawn across the surface. The present lithograph is closely comparable to this series of paintings in the use of successive layers of short strokes of different colours."

For Heron dispensing with figurative imagery was a liberating experience, allowing him to 'deal more directly and inventively... with every single aspect of the painting that is purely pictorial, i.e. the architecture of the canvas, the spatial interrelation of each and every touch (and stroke, or bar) of colour... with a sense of freedom quite denied to me when I still had to keep half an eye on a 'subject' The painting covers an earlier, figurative work, traces of which can be discerned.

        "description": "Heron was a critic and painter who championed an approach to painting that assessed quality according to such formal values as the flatness of a composition and colour. Of his stripe paintings he wrote, ‘The reason why the stripes sufficed ... was precisely that they were so very uncomplicated as shapes ... the emptier the general format was, the more exclusive the concentration upon the experiences of colour itself.’ Heron resisted the total abandoning of subject matter and even such works as this have been seen in relation to landscape, the horizontal bands and colours perhaps suggesting the horizon at sunset."

From 1957 he had begun to experiment with vertical and horizontal bands of colour in his paintings. With this particular work Heron now combined both elements on the same canvas. Built up over time, the different layers of colours intersected, overlapped and ate away at one another, creating the soft-edged square shapes now visible. As the artist himself explained: 'I did not draw these shapes in this configuration - the shapes and their relationship grew out of this process of allowing each colour area to adjust physically to adjacent colour areas'."

Even when he eliminated recognisable subject matter, Heron’s abstractions stemmed from his observations of the visual world. He denied that he consciously painted ‘landscapes’, but affirmed: ‘the enormously powerful rhythmic energies of the granite outcrops beneath my feet transmit certain rhythms straight up through the soles of my shoes every minute of the day.’"

        "description": "In a letter (dated 14 July 1986), the artist wrote: \"In the summer of 1967 I broke my right leg very badly in an accident in the sea at Lamorna Cove involving a canoe. My entire leg was encased in plaster for nine months - for four of which I afterwards discovered the surgeon had contemplated amputation at the knee. As a result I was unable to paint a single canvas for nearly a year - as distinct from works on paper, which could be done in a sitting position. When I finally started painting canvases again I for some reason decided very greatly to enlarge their scale, setting to work on a series of paintings measuring nine, eleven, thirteen and even fifteen feet in length. This painting was one of that series, all of which were exhibited in January 1970 at Waddington's original gallery at number 2, Cork Street, where they were slightly cramped for space, of course.\r\n\r\nUnlike Rothko, who, in 1960, showed me the flat in Manhattan where he'd been living and painting until well after he'd enlarged the scale of his canvases to the familiar size of his mature style, with the result that his paintings were touching each other all around the walls of his living-room-cum-studio, as he explained to me - I, myself, have always needed very considerable space for showing my paintings. I've always felt that my canvases simply cannot be seen if they are not more or less isolated by expanses of white wall all around them. Rothko, in total contrast, actually prescribed very close hanging - about 18 ins. between each work. I therefore most enjoyed seeing this painting of mine at the Royal Academy's 1977 exhibition British Painting 1952–1977, where it was isolated on a specially built screen in the centre of one of the galleries, from where it was visible from down a vista of several rooms. The result was that it floated.\r\n\r\nAbout the painting itself, it so happens that I mentioned it in the Power Lecture, entitled ‘The Shape of Colour’, which I gave in Australia in 1973. The following is part of what I said there: \"For instance, in 1969, I arrived at a series of very large paintings ... ‘Cadmium with Violet, Scarlet, Emerald, Lemon and Venetian: 1969’ is an example. Looking back, the object here seems to have been to see how far a few of the familiar elements could be stretched out sideways, with this long horizontal composition (and there's a word, ‘composition’, we needn't run away from), without that largest area of cadmium-red disintegrating back into that vacuous background of neutral nothingness I so much despise! I used to say, as far back as 1959, that what one was looking for, in stretching out a single colour-plane across four-fifths of a canvas, was a full emptiness or an empty fullness. In these very long, very large paintings of 1969 and after, I think one has added to that earlier requirement of ‘full emptiness’ this new one: to see how big a colour-area can become physically while still retaining a visible compactness in its image, a tightness in its design and organisation that remains totally readable, despite the expanded scale of that design, of those images. How far could one expand one's colour-areas without appearing to be distending any or all of them? I have painted a version of this ‘Cadmium with Violet’, with the same colours but on a format only nine inches long. One of the mysteries of scale which seeing the two versions together would demonstrate is to do with what I call the physicality of mere size: the plain physical impact of a large painting, the sheerly quantitative bombardment by the vibrations of really big areas of colour - these constitute a totally new factor. It was simply a fact that, in painting large, one was entering a field of physical sensation which just was not given off by smaller paintings.\r\n\r\nIt used to be felt that two adjacent areas of flat but differing colours - say a red or a blue - would always take up a fixed spatial position in relation to one another along the line dividing them. It used to be said that the red would always appear to come in front of the blue. My own experience suggests that this is quite untrue. When your eye alights on the sharp linear frontier separating two colour-areas, your sensation that one of those colours is ‘nearer’ to you than the other - this sensation, this conviction that space-in-depth separates the two colour-areas, is overwhelmingly definite as a sensation. Its cause, however, is enormously difficult to pinpoint. In these large recent paintings such as ‘Cadmium with Violet’ one is extremely conscious, as one's eye moves along the frontiers of the various areas, that these areas actually alternate with one another (as one's eye moves) in seeming to be behind or in front of one another - according to whatever loop or angle in the frontier one happens to be focusing upon. For instance, the cadmium-red ground (if you'll excuse the term) does not appear to be uniformly either behind or in front of the more orange ‘harbour-shape’ which extends downwards from the top right-hand corner of the painting. On the contrary, as your eye slides round those outlines the cadmium and the orange [scarlet] appear to keep exchanging their spatial positions. In ‘Colour in My Painting: 1969’ I said ‘Complexity of the spatial illusion generated along the frontier where the two colours meet is ... enormously increased if the linear character of those frontiers is irregular, freely drawn, intuitively arrived at.’ It is the totally regular, the perfectly geometric lines between colours in the movement known as Op Art which distinguishes it entirely from my own-despite our shared interest in optical after-images, and so on. The after-image is for me merely a welcome by-product, not a calculated end-product.\"\r\n\r\nThe period of my work to which this painting belongs came to an end with the paintings I made for my retrospective at the University of Texas at Austin Art Museum during 1977, the year before that exhibition was held (1978). I called them ‘wobbly hard-edge’ when I showed in Australia. Since 1980 the interests pursued in my painting have moved away from the rather exclusive preoccupations described in the long passage from ‘The Shape of Colour’ which I've quoted above.\""
