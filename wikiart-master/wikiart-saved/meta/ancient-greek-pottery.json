        "description": "Monumental grave markers were first introduced during the Geometric period. They were large vases, often decorated with funerary representations. It was only in the Archaic period that stone sculptures were used as funerary monuments. On this magnificent krater, the main scene occupies the widest portion of the vase and shows the deceased laid upon a bier surrounded by members of his household and, at either side, mourners. For optimal clarity, the dead man is shown on his side, and the checkered shroud that would normally cover the body has been raised and regularized into a long rectangle with two projections. The zone below shows a procession of chariots and foot soldiers. The figures may refer to the military exploits of the deceased. Because hourglass shields and chariots played a more limited role at this time than in the earlier Bronze Age, the scene more likely evokes the glorious ancestry and traditions to which the dead man belonged.\n\nAttributed to the Hirschfeld Workshop\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/248904]The Met[/url]"

        "description": "The Vatican amphora depicts Achilles and Ajax playing a board game, with both men identified by their names added in the genitive. Ajax and Achilles sit across from each other, looking down at a block situated between them. The board game they are playing, which might be compared to a backgammon or checkers variant, was played with a die. According to the words written next to the two players, Achilles proclaims he has thrown a four, while Ajax has a three. Although the two of them are pictured playing, they are clearly depicted as being on duty, accompanied by their body armor and holding their spears, suggesting that they might head back into battle at any moment. There are small details that Exekias adds to this piece that separate it from other depictions of this narrative. Achilles is shown with his helmet still resting on his head which represents he has more power than Ajax. Also, Ajax is shown with his heel slightly lifted, suggesting that he is nervous in the presence of Achilles. Apart from the selection of this very intimate, seemingly relaxed scene as a symbol for the Trojan War, this vase-painting also showcases the talent of Exekias as an artist: the figures of both Achilles and Ajax are decorated with fine incised details, showing elaborate textile patterns and almost every hair in place. There is no extant literary source that is known to have circulated in the sixth century BC in Athens regarding a narrative involving Ajax and Achilles playing a board game. Exekias may have drawn his inspiration for this innovative composition from local oral bardic traditions regarding the Trojan War, which may have developed during his lifetime in the cultural context of sixth century Athens.[26] Despite the ambiguity surrounding the origin of this mythological narrative, Exekias' new depiction of Ajax and Achilles playing a board game was popular and was copied over 150 times in the ensuing fifty years.\n\nAttributed to Exekias"

Geryon lived on an island in the far west with his herdsman, Eurytion, and dog, Orthros. Here, Herakles takes aim with his arrow against Geryon, one of whose bodies is falling. The subject was popular in the sixth century B.C.; several representations in stone can be seen in the Cypriot galleries on the second floor.

The warriors wear their helmets and hold two spears each. Ajax has his right hand near the board, ready to play when his turn comes. Both heroes wear short tunics (chitoniskoi), and are armed, with corslet, cushes, greaves; they wear short cloaks over their armour. Behind them, their shields lean against something, with their helmets perched on top; behind them, or beside them at arm’s reach. Both sit with the hither leg drawn back; Ajax is farther from the table than Achilles, although he sits farther forward on his block (thakos).\n\nCondition: Large pieces have been restored.

With the help of a magic cap and winged shoes given to him by Athena, Perseus became invisible and flew to the place where the three sisters were asleep. There he cut off Medusa's head. On this vase, Perseus flees with the head in a sack as the immortal winged horse Pegasos springs from the body of the dead Gorgon. Perseus and the horse are shown in the traditional black-figure manner, while the Gorgon is drawn in outline, probably influenced by the newly developed red-figure technique.\n\nAttributed to the Diosphos Painter\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247488]The Met[/url]"

        "description": "This Attic White Ground kylix of the early 5th century BC has a most distinctive depiction of the Apollo. The god wears a white sleeveless chiton, which is fastened with pins at the shoulders, and a red himation wrapped around the lower part of his body. He sits on a cross-legged stool. A myrtle wreath garnishes his carelessly bound hair. He performs a libation by pouring wine out of a bowl with his right hand, while holding a seven-stringed lyre, whose sound-box is made of a turtle-shell, in his left hand. A raven looks on. This scene could allude to the myth of King Phlegyas's daughter Koronida (from the Greek korone = raven), who was in love with Apollo, although some scholars believe it is simply a bird with prophetic powers. These colourful figures on a white background are typical of Attic vase-painting of the early 5th century BC. This kylix is the work of an unknown artist, which some scholars identify with the so-called Berlin painter."

With the help of the gods and the sorceress Medea, Jason was able to take the fleece from a grove protected by a dragon. Here, with Athena beside him, he reaches for the fleece. A companion prepares to board the ship.\nThe basis of the legend of the Golden Fleece is probably the ancient practice of extracting alluvial gold by causing the deposits in a stream to wash over a fleece, thereby catching the gold-bearing material in the curly pelt.\n\nAttributed to the Orchard Painter\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/253427]The Met[/url]"

        "description": "[i]Obverse and reverse, Dionysos, the god of wine, with his followers, satyrs and maenads[/i]\n\nBelonging to the group around the Villa Giulia Painter, the Methyse Painter takes his name from the lyre-playing maenad in front of Dionysos (methyse means \"drunk\"). The figures' incipient inebriation is subtly suggested. The key is Dionysos—slow-moving with downcast, introverted expression and stabilized by a young satyr who wraps his arms around the god's middle. The satyrs and maenads on the reverse are more active. One maenad holds her thyrsos (fennel stalk) ready to parry an assault. The figures under each handle are engaged in an eternal pursuit.\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247965]The Met[/url]"

The Niobid Painter is remembered particularly for mythological representations on large pots. Here, on a smaller scale, he depicts Triptolemos being dispatched by the goddess Demeter, the patroness of fertility and agriculture, and her daughter, Persephone, to teach the cultivation of grain to humanity. The great attraction of this legend—to the artist and the viewer—lies in the winged car that transports Triptolemos. The model here comes \"loaded\" with snakes.\n\nAttributed to the Niobid Painter\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/254270]\nThe Met[/url]"

Around the body, Amazonomachy (battle between Greeks and Amazons)[/i]\n\nThe ancient Greeks almost never depicted contemporary or historical events in art. Thus, while literary works of the fifth century B.C. make clear that the Greeks understood the magnitude of their victory in the Persian Wars, there was no concern among artists to illustrate major events or personalities. Instead, their preference was for grand mythological battles between Greeks and eastern adversaries, notably Amazons. The Amazons were a mythical race of warrior women whose homeland lay far to the east and north. The most celebrated Amazonomachies in Athens during the first half of the fifth century were large-scale wall paintings that decorated the Theseion and the Stoa Poikile (the Painted Portico). Their influence was considerable and underlies the representation here.\n\nAttributed to the Painter of the Woolly Satyrs\n\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247964]The Met[/url]"

        "description": "[i]Obverse, Perseus beheading the sleeping Medusa. Reverse, King Polypeithes between two women[/i]\n\nKing Polydektes sent Perseus to obtain the head of the Gorgon Medusa, a monstrous, snaky-haired, winged creature with glaring eyes whose gaze turned beholders to stone. Perseus accomplished his mission with the help of Athena, Hermes and the Nymphs, and returned to the island of Seriphos whence he had set out. By the mid-fifth century B.C., the story and the motif of the Gorgon's head had become popular in Attic art. Perseus looks unwaveringly at his protectress, Athena as he is about to behead the sleeping Medusa. The rendering here is unusual, however, because it is one of the earliest in which Medusa's face is that of a beautiful young woman. Another important feature here, although not longer readily visible, is that rays surround the hero's head, indicating special stature or power. \nCompared with the movement and detail on the obverse, the reverse shows a grand and quiet scene of a king—who is not otherwise known—between two women holding the standard offering utensils. \nPolygnotos was a rather current name in classical Athens. It is most often associated with Polygnotos of Thasos who painted large-scale wall paintings in Athens and Delphi that are described in ancient literary sources.\n\nAttributed to Polygnotos\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/254523]The Met[/url]"

        "description": "[i]The abduction of Persephone by Hades surrounded by gods\n[/i]\nThe myth of the abduction of Persephone was situated in Sicily. Hades’ chariot occupies the most prominent area of the vase. All around appear deities connected with the event—Zeus, Hades’ brother, whose sanction was needed; Aphrodite and Eros, abettors of Hades’ desire; Demeter, Persephone’s mother; torch-bearing Hecate; and Athena. The vegetation in the scene and the choice of a water jar as the shape emphasize the aspect of fertility in the story. Mythological subjects such as this commonly decorated funerary vases.\n\nAttributed to the Group of B.M. F 308\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247597]The Met[/url]"

        "description": "[i]Obverse: the Judgment of Paris.[/i] The Trojan prince is seated in the center, dressed in Eastern garb. He listens to Hermes, standing to his right, who has brought the three goddesses to him to be judged. Aphrodite, accompanied by Eros is in the upper left, seated beside a large box, holding a wreath and a mirror. Hera, holding her scepter is seated in the upper right on a rock. Athena, directly below Paris, is also seated, leaning on her shield, wearing her helmet and holding a large phiale. Athena is attended by two youths, who, like Paris, are in Eastern costume. In the same register, at the extreme left, a young Pan, leaning on a rock, observes the scene. On the neck: frontal head of a woman wearing a Phrygian cap emerging from a blossom, surrounded by flowers and tendrils. On the handles, in relief, heads of Io with blonde hair. \n\n[i]Reverse: naiskos with a statue of the deceased woman holding a wreath, a long sash, and a flower.[/i] Around the naiskos four mourners. Above, on either side is a seated youth holding a box; the one on the left also holds grapes. The other, a situla. Below, also arranged symetrically, a woman approaches on eighter side, holding a mirror and an oinochoe. On the handles in relief, heads of Io with black hair.\n\nAttributed to the Baltimore Painter\n\n[url href=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/255282]The Met[/url]"
