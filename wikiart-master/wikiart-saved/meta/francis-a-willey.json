        "description": "Remembering Kiki\nGelatin Silver Print \nOlympus OM 1: Ilford hp5: 35mm \nFrancis A Willey \n2003\n\nThis image was inspired by the journals of the life of Kiki de Montparnasse : \nAlice Prin, An enigmatical woman that influenced culture in Paris during the 20's and 30's. She was known as the \"Queen of Montparnasse. She was a model, a muse and lover of many famous artists, but also a singer, dancer, cabaret manager, painter and film actress. \nAnimating and enchanting the Montparnasse district during the interwar Wars (1921-1939). She influenced many surrealists and filmmakers, poets and novelists. I believe she challenged a male dominant art scene at that time. Influencing the likes of Francis Picabia, Jean Cocteau, Man Ray, Picasso, Dali, Ernest Hemingway, Tsuguharu Foujita- to name a few.\n\n a timeless portrait in her honour as an influential woman in Paris, but also as a woman that inspired artists to create more art and literature."

        "description": "At the tender age of nine, Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) met Beatrice Portinari (1266–1290), declaring to his soul, “Now is your bliss made manifest,” to which it replied, “Alas! How often henceforth shall we be troubled.”\n\nRestricted by the dictates of courtly love, Beatrice ignored Dante, yet she came to embody the divine incarnation of love that inspired him throughout his life.\n\nIn The Divine Comedy, a literary masterpiece, Beatrice is Dante's guide on his pilgrimage through Paradise, leading him finally into the presence of the divine.\n\nThis image represents Beatrice flying in a dream. Dante's love is so great for Beatrice he enters her dream and rests his head on her shoulder. At this moment, he takes flight with Beatrice \nwhile she rises to the rose in Paradise.\n\nAn angelic throng that makes a ring and the beginning of a premonition."

By deliberate \"borrowing\". His photograph Blindness has had re-interpretations in a multitude of languages, social, political and religious contexts and ideologies and memes. Also has been used for medical, psychological and surgical papers on the subject of blindness or physical blindness. As a defining cultural image to various blogs, educational papers or been a companion to poetry, verse and novels and theatrical and dance productions. Blindness is used to represent many facets of life as an iconic symbol for freedom. Blindness has been graffitied on delivery trucks, walls, painted, re-drawn, sketched, collaged and juxtaposed with text and is continuously re-interpreted and appropriated and re-contextualized."
