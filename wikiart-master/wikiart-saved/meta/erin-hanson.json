The expressionist movement of brush strokes captures the vibrancy and color of the poppies, thistles and daisies growing among the grasses. The abstracted shapes of the landscape come together in a harmony of motion and color.\n\nThis painting measures 13 feet wide by 6 1/2 feet tall. The stretched canvas is 3\" deep, with the painting continued around the edges.\n\nERIN HANSON is a life-long painter, beginning her study of oils as a young child.  Her passion for natural beauty is seen in her work as she transforms vistas familiar and rare into stunning interpretations of bold color, playful rhythms and raw emotional impact. Her frequent forays into National Parks and other recesses of nature include backpacking expeditions, rock climbing, and photo safaris.  Hanson's unique painting style has become known as Open Impressionism, with hundreds of collectors eagerly anticipating her work.  As an iconic, driving force in the rebirth of contemporary impressionism, Hanson is quickly recognized as a prolific, modern master."
