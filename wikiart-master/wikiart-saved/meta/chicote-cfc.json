Something that sets the need of exercise a balance of them emotions, them passions and them tensions, that by equal parity have of keep is measured in the interior of the brain to get it healthy sanity. The Supreme harmony would go through the fair and comparable compensation from all those forces which exert pressure on the mind. The harmonic requires the interior of the individual strength to adapt to possible imbalances in sensitive instability.\nSearch everything that give us something positive, the semblance and the temple to negative events, the perseverance of the illusion to keep targets in the distance, prioritize about what endures and leave little time devoted to the ephemeral, they are some of the keys that help balance the scale of optimism."

        "description": "According to the theory of neurosis of \"Karen Horney\", arrogance is the product of the compensation that occurs in the ego by having an inflated self-image. Therefore the person intends to exercise the rights that he believes have the importance attributed to itself, based on his self-image; while others see it and recognize what it is. Selfishness, narcissism, vanity, self-centeredness, arrogance and pride are so only some of the consequences of position in a high level of self-esteem the ego personal. This is what today exudes in abundance in a great plurality of individuals at all socio-cultural levels. Such conduct us leads to the conclusion of think that participate of a considerable legitimacy and to demand greater rights and privileges of which actually us correspond. Arrogance hinders the approximation and understanding between individuals to take under consideration that one is possessed of reason and truth.\n\"Allegory in terms of metaphor to the deification, enhancement of the personal self. There is a predisposition towards the arrogance in the subconscious of the individual that prevents him from being an impartial observer, away you learning and preparing you to be a breeding ground of ignorance.\""

The mass of a body significantly alters the shape of the environment which it is situated and also happens with time. Those objects that possess a great mass are capable of make that converge towards itself themselves, by the deformation that its weight exerts in the space, of all those elements of lower mass that you orbit and with this is explains the why Newton understood that existed a \"force\" that called \"gravity\" that was that them objects tend to be glued to the Center planetary. The question that some physical is pose is... in the inside of a hole black, in which the mass and the time are completely collapsed, would be possible travel in the time...? \"Still not is theory clear any that defines the origin of black holes in space, but possibly a future and broader study about them we provide keys to understand how it behaves inside time.\"\n\"Theoretical principle of formation of a black hole in which shows the deformation of space and failing time\"."
