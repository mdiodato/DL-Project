Castle of Szigliget is bordered by LAKE BALATON in the south and by Tapolca turf field and mountains in the north. Wherever we approach Szigliget the old castle unfolds from all direction. Castle of Szigliget is one of our few castles that never bore the Ottoman ensign on its towers in the Turkish times. Manful soldiers maintained their independence for 150 years, only the Habsburg-hate destroyed it, blowing up his walls. (tripadvisor.com)\n\nLAKE BALATON is a freshwater lake in the Transdanubian region of Hungary. It is the largest lake in Central Europe, and one of the region's foremost tourist destinations. \n\nThe mountainous region of the northern shore is known both for its historic character and as a major wine region, while the flat southern shore is known for its resort towns. Balatonfüred and Hévíz developed early as resorts for the wealthy.( Wikipedia)"

        "description": "TAPOLCA - HUNGARY\n\nThe Lake Cave\n\nThis 3 km long lake cave system is situated in the heart of the town. It was opened to the public in 1912, ten years after its discovery. Small boats can be hired to explore the cave system. At 15–20 m below the town, a 5 km long cave system criss-crosses the Miocene limestone layers. This includes the 3.3 km long Lake Cave, which is mostly filled with karst water. The cave was discovered in 1903 during well digging. Thanks to these explorations, round boat trips were made possible from 1937. Because of its special origin and unique formations, it was designated a protected area in 1942 and placed under strict protection in 1982. The mixture of the cold karst water flowing there and the thermal water up-surging from the deep dissolves limestone. Initially narrow passages, then smaller and larger niches were formed. Over a very long period, these widened into spacious chambers and passages. Dripstones have not developed in the cave, as several metre thick clay deposits prevents infiltration from the surface. Only calcareous formations (cave corals and aragonite crystals) occur at some places, having precipitated from the cave air. Bats cannot enter the closed spaces, so the largest vertebrate is a 10 cm long fish, the Common minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus L.), which probably swims in through the wet passages from the Malom-tó (Mill Pond). The cave air, with nearly 100% humidity, a high calcium content and a constant temperature of 20 °C, is used to cure respiratory diseases in the branches under the town hospital that are in close proximity with the cave. The radon content of the cave air is too low to have any effect on the visitors.(Wikipedia)"

        "description": "Franz KAFKA (1883-1924) was a German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short-story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature.\n\n\"THE CASTLE\" is a 1926 novel by Franz Kafka. In it a protagonist known only as \"K.\" arrives in a village and struggles to gain access to the mysterious authorities who govern it from a castle.\n\nKafka is best known for his short story Metamorphosis (1912) and the widespread familiarity of the literary term Kafkaesque, inspired by his nightmarishly complex and bizarre yet absurd and impersonal short stories.(Wikipedia)"

        "description": "Saint John the Baptist\nJohn the Baptist is mentioned by the Jewish historian Josephus and revered as a major religious figurein Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these faiths, and is honored as a saint in many Christian traditions. According to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself, and the Gospels portray John as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus, since John announces Jesus' coming and prepares the people for Jesus' ministry. Jesus himself identifies John as \"Elijah who is to come\", which some biblical scholars interpret to mean that Jesus believed that John was the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Elijah. According to the New Testament, John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth were relatives.(Wikipedia)"

        "description": "Lázeňská street is a charming area in Prague, known for its palaces, manicured gardens, churches and more. Visitors’ favorite area, captivates with its splendid Old-World appearance.\n\nFamous composer Ludwig van BEETHOVEN went in Prague twice - in 1796 and in 1798. During his first visit, he stayed in guesthouse \"U Zlatého Jednorožce / At Golden unicorn\" at LAZENSKA Street. He preferred not to lodge in the centre of the city (may be following a personal permanent characteristic) but at the other side of Charles Bridge. In the very particular Prague's quarter called Mala Strana (The lesser Town). This place was usually frequented by artists and musicians back then. The building in which he lived is in the Nº 11 (in the past Nº 285) of LAZENSKA Street, in a baroque hotel, that today is called Beethoven Palace. When turning on the corner of the main entrance of the building, you can see the old entrance, where a plaque commemorates this famous man.(waymarking.com)"

        "description": "Paul CLAUDEL (1868-1955), poet, playwright, essayist, a towering force in French literature of the first half of the 20th century.\nCLAUDEL best-known and most impressive lyrical works are the ambitious, confessional \"Cinq grandes odes\" (1910). Later volumes, which consist of poems written at various times, lack the symbolic unity that holds the odes together. He very early adopted a long, unscanned, usually unrhymed line that came to be known as the verset claudélien, which is his unique contribution to French prosody. (britannica.com)"

She was the younger sister of St. Kinga of Poland (Kunegunda) and the Blessed Yolanda of Poland and, through her father, the niece of the famed Saint Elizabeth of Hungary.\n\nMargaret was born in Klis Fortress in the Kingdom of Croatia, the eighth and last daughter (9th of 10 children) of the royal couple. They resided there during the Mongol invasion of Hungary (1241–42) as her father was also ruler of this land. Her parents vowed that if Hungary was liberated from the Mongols, they would dedicate the child to religion.\n\nThe three-year-old Margaret was entrusted by her parents to the Dominican monastery at Veszprém in 1245. Six years later she was transferred to the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin founded by her parents on Nyulak Szigete (Rabbit Island) near Buda (today Margaret Island, named after her, and a part of Budapest; the ruins of the monastery can still be seen). She spent the rest of her life there, dedicating herself to religion and opposing all attempts of her father to arrange a political marriage for her with King Ottokar II of Bohemia.(Wikipedia)"

By ridding Hungarian literature of overwhelming classical and German influence, he made it national not only in language but in spirit.\n\nCsongor and Tünde is regarded by many of Vörösmarty's critics as the climax of his poetic achievement” (Oxfordshire: Clarendon Press,1984, 130).\n\nCsongor és Tünde is a play that calls for free choice in both the personal and social or\nnational spheres. In the opening lines Csongor, the main protagonist, declares that he is looking\nfor “the lady of his dreams,” but in his quest for his Love he necessarily also has to face social\nand political challenges, as in the poetic-dramatic tradition and political reality of the\nplaywright's time these two missions were seen as intertwined and mutually mirrored or symbolized.\n \nThe plot is anchored in the sixteenth-century Hungarian Árgirius romance. \n\nCsongor soon realizes that the paths of the three travelers (Csongor, Ilma and Balga) he has described in the lines just quoted are futile, but it is Balga, Csongor's realistic companion, who offers earth-based alternatives to Csongor’s lofty ideals.\n\nWhile on his quest, Csongor has to face the scheming of ill-meaning Suckbane [Hung.\nMirigy], who plots against him, while Csongor receives only little help from others, except for\nBalga, who keeps grounding him in reality. As expected, in the play's finale all of its earth-bound\nas well as ethereal entanglements are resolved. The three travelers break apart, the lovers are\nunited and Tünde calls upon her Love.\n\nVörösmarty’s questions are substantially much more existential than poetic: “Are human beings capable of achieving happiness? Is there a kind of happiness that completely satisfies man?” (ahea.pitt.edu)\n\nLeó Weiner (1885-1960) composer, published about 30 works, the best known of which is his witty incidental music for Mihály Vörösmarty's fairy play Csongor és Tünde (1903).

She received a humanistic education and from early on was fascinated by literature. As a result of her interest she later frequented the literary circles of Vienna.\n\nShe married the Hungarian author János Batsányi in 1805. Her husband translated Napoleon's proclamation into Hungarian after which, as a traitor, he was obliged to flee to Paris, taking his wife with him.\n\nAfter the end of the Napoleonic Wars Batsányi was handed over to the Austrian authorities, who at first imprisoned him in Vienna and then exiled him to Linz. Gabriele accompanied him to both places, and died in Linz in 1839.\n\nShe wrote short poems and prose pieces throughout her life. (Wikipedia)"

The first Lobkowiczs were members of the gentry of north-eastern Bohemia in the late 14th century.(Wikipedia)\n\nRoudnice is a village in the Hradec Králové region in eastern Bohemia, the Czech Republic.\nThe village is home to Roudnice Castle, the fourth largest castle in the Czech Republic. The first structure on the site of the castle was a fortress built in the 12th century, a popular summer retreat for Prague’s archbishops and supposedly where Jan Hus was ordained as a priest. In the 14th and 15th centuries the original Romanesque building gained Gothic additions as it moved from religious to secular ownership.\nThe fortress passed into the hands of the Lobkowicz family in 1603.(Wikipedia)"

In the same year he obtained a job as clerk in the treasury of the Hungarian city of Kassa (Košice), and there, in conjunction with other two Hungarian patriots, edited the Magyar Museum, which was suppressed by the government in 1792.\nIn the following year he was deprived of his clerkship and in 1794, having taken part in the conspiracy of Ignác Martinovics, he was thrown into the state prison of the Kufstein Fortress, where he remained for two years.\nAfter his release, he took a considerable share in the Magyar Minerva, a literary review, and then proceeded to Vienna, where he obtained a post in the bank. He married Gabriella Baumberg, a renowned poet from Vienna in 1805. Four years later he translated Napoleon's proclamation to the Hungarians, and, in consequence of this anti-Habsburg act, had to take refuge in Paris.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon he was given up to the Austrians, who allowed him to reside at Linz until his death.\n\nGabriella Baumberg (1766-1839) wife of János Batsányi (also Bacsányi), was an Austrian author and poet.\nVon Baumberg was born in Vienna, the daughter of an Austrian civil servant. She received a humanistic education and from early on was fascinated by literature. As a result of her interest she later frequented the literary circles of Vienna.\nShe married the Hungarian author János Batsányi in 1805. Her husband translated Napoleon's proclamation into Hungarian after which, as a traitor, he was obliged to flee to Paris, taking his wife with him.\nAfter the end of the Napoleonic Wars Batsányi was handed over to the Austrian authorities, who at first imprisoned him in Vienna and then exiled him to Linz. Gabriele accompanied him to both places, and died in Linz in 1839.\nShe wrote short poems and prose pieces throughout her life."

        "description": "Claude DEBUSSY was a French composer. He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.(Wikipedia)\n\n\"Debussy (1862-1918) was – and still is – known for his innovative music. During his life, the Romantic Era was coming to a close. Composers everywhere explored new ways to create sound and atmosphere in their music. Debussy led the way in using music as a means to explore images and color.\n\nAfter completing his orchestral work La Mer, Debussy returned to the piano with Images Book 1. His fresh, orchestral perspective gleaned from the massive symphonic work guided his hand in composing Images, and this piano work showcases his creative and unique compositional style. Each individual movement uses subtlety in melody, harmony, and rhythm to create an expressive sound world.\"(pianistmusings.com)"

He wrote both verse and highly lyrical prose.\" (Wikipedia)\n\n\n\"Duino Elegies\", series of 10 poems by Rainer Maria Rilke, published in German as Duineser Elegien in 1923.\n\nAcknowledged as Rilke’s finest achievement (with the possible exception of his Sonnets to Orpheus) and one of the century’s poetic masterpieces, the Duino Elegies is praised for its supple language, its experimentation with metre and rhyme, and its profound meditation on human existence. Scholars note that the poems are more elegiac in mood than in form.\" (britannica.com)\n\n\"Almost legendary image of the circumstances in which the composition of this great poem began. Rainer Maria Rilke was staying at Duino Castle, on a rocky headland of the Adriatic sea near Trieste. One morning he walked out onto the battlements and climbed down to where the cliffs dropped sharply to the sea. From out of the fierce wind, Rilke seemed to hear a voice: Wer, wenn ich schriee, horte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen? (If I cried out, who would hear me up there, among the angelic orders?). He wrote these words, the opening of the first Duino Elegy, in his notebook, then went inside to continue what was to be his major opus—completely only after another ten, tormented years of effort—and one of the literary masterpieces of the century. Duino Elegies speaks in a voice that is both intimate and majestic on the mysteries of human life and our attempt, in the words of the translator David Young, “to use our self-consciousness to some advantage: to transcend, through art and the imagination, our self-deception and our fear.” (Goodreads)"

He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.(Wikipedia)\n\nTHE STORY OF DEBUSSY’S “THE SUNKEN CATHEDRAL”, the \"Legend of Ys\"\n\nThis piece is based on an ancient Breton myth in which a cathedral, submerged underwater off the coast of the Island of Ys, rises up from the sea on clear mornings when the water is transparent. Sounds can be heard of priests chanting, bells chiming, and the organ playing, from across the sea. Accordingly, Debussy uses certain harmonies to allude to the plot of the legend, in the style of musical symbolism.\n(Wikipedia)"

        "description": "Mihály Vörösmarty, (1800-1855), poet and dramatist who helped make the literature of Hungary truly Hungarian during the era (1825–49) of social reforms. By ridding Hungarian literature of overwhelming classical and German influence, he made it national not only in language but in spirit.\n\nCsongor and Tünde is regarded by many of Vörösmarty's critics as the climax of his poetic achievement” (Oxfordshire: Clarendon Press,1984, 130).\n\nCsongor és Tünde is a play that calls for free choice in both the personal and social or\nnational spheres. In the opening lines Csongor, the main protagonist, declares that he is looking\nfor “the lady of his dreams,” but in his quest for his Love he necessarily also has to face social\nand political challenges, as in the poetic-dramatic tradition and political reality of the\nplaywright's time these two missions were seen as intertwined and mutually mirrored or symbolized.\n \nThe plot is anchored in the sixteenth-century Hungarian Árgirius romance. \n\nCsongor soon realizes that the paths of the three travelers (Csongor, Ilma and Balga) he has described in the lines just quoted are futile, but it is Balga, Csongor's realistic companion, who offers earth-based alternatives to Csongor’s lofty ideals.\n\nWhile on his quest, Csongor has to face the scheming of ill-meaning Suckbane [Hung.\nMirigy], who plots against him, while Csongor receives only little help from others, except for\nBalga, who keeps grounding him in reality. As expected, in the play's finale all of its earth-bound\nas well as ethereal entanglements are resolved. The three travelers break apart, the lovers are\nunited and Tünde calls upon her Love.\n\nVörösmarty’s questions are substantially much more existential than poetic: “Are human beings capable of achieving happiness? Is there a kind of happiness that completely satisfies man?” (ahea.pitt.edu)\n\nLeó Weiner (1885-1960) composer, published about 30 works, the best known of which is his witty incidental music for Mihály Vörösmarty's fairy play Csongor és Tünde (1903).

        "description": "\"Les sonnets à Orphée\"\n\"The Sonnets to Orpheus (German: Die Sonette an Orpheus)[1] are a cycle of 55 sonnets written in 1922 by the Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875–1926). It was first published the following year. Rilke, who is \"widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets, wrote the cycle in a period of three weeks experiencing what he described a \"savage creative storm. Inspired by the news of the death of Wera Ouckama Knoop (1900–1919), a playmate of Rilke's daughter Ruth, he dedicated them as a memorial, or Grab-Mal (literally \"grave-marker\"), to her memory. \"(Wikipedia)"
