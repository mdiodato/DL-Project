        "description": "This impressive work by the Milanese painter Bernardino Luini provides an important key in understanding the artist's early artistic career.  The attribution to Luini, which had previously been accepted by all scholars but one, is indisputable in light of the presence of his signature and date; something which had been previously ignored in all the literature as the signature only recently emerged after cleaning.  The discovery of the artist's signature is extremely important in shedding light on Luini's early artistic development, particularly in the light of the paucity of documentary evidence covering this period.  Until now scholars had found it extremely difficult to establish an early chronology for Luini’s oeuvre and indeed for anything prior to his first securely datable commission, the frescoes of 1512 in the Abbey of Chiaravalle, near Milan.  The authorship of the Saint Sebastian is closely linked to that of a panel showing The Madonna and Child with Saints Augustine, Margaret and two music-making angels in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris, and it thus provides an important stepping stone between the Paris picture and later works given to Luini.1  The Paris panel is signed and dated Bernardino Mediolanensis Faciebat MDVII (1507); its form of signature denoting the emphasis the artist has placed on his town of origin (‘Mediolanensis’ meaning Milanese).  It has been plausibly argued that he would only have done so if executing the panel away from Milan, and Luini’s possible absence from the city during the first decade of the 16th century seems corroborated by the few documents that have come to light.  Luini’s uncle Pietro de Scapis is recorded as acting on his nephew’s behalf in two documents of 1504 and 1507, suggesting that Luini may indeed have been absent from Milan in these years.2  The panel’s early provenance from the Manfrin collection in Venice has led scholars to presume Luini visited that city and, at first glance, the painting in the Musée Jacquemart-André does indeed appear extremely Venetic.  The ‘sacra conversazione’ format and figure-types are reminiscent of Giovanni Bellini and, in particular, of Cima da Conegliano, but the painting’s Lombard roots are equally in evidence: as Giulio Bora has observed, the influence of Andrea Solario and Ambrogio Bergognone is apparent in the figures of the angels and in the execution of details such as their hair.3  There is no doubt that artists active during the first quarter of the 16th century in Lombardy and the Veneto were closely linked: Bartolomeo Veneto, Marco Marziale and Gian Francesco Caroto all worked in both regions, and thus the idea that Luini may have travelled there is by no means implausible.\n\nAt first glance the Saint Sebastian also appears to be rooted in the Venetian tradition, particularly with its use of a polychromed architectural setting, but the influence of the Lombard High Renaissance painters is also marked and, as Franco Moro has pointed out, that of Bramantino in particular. The manner in which the light plays over the saint’s torso, although normally associated with Venetian painting, is (as Bayer points out) ‘a fundamental descriptive tool... also an important element of the Lombard tradition, beginning with Vincenzo Foppa and then reinforced and elaborated by Leonardo’s example’.4\n\nThe Saint Sebastian has been correctly associated, first by Anna Ottino Della Chiesa and later by Bernard Berenson, with three other panels of similar dimensions representing Saint Peter, Saint Martha and A Bishop Saint in the Borromeo collection on the Isola Bella (Novara).5  It has been convincingly argued that all three panels once formed part of a single polyptych: indeed they each represent a saint, shown from a low viewpoint and standing full-length before a niche, holding his or her attribute.  Sebastian’s pose echoes that of Peter; their feet are in exactly the same position (one seen frontally and the other in profile) and their bodies are placed just left of centre, pointing right, thus indicating that they must have originally stood to the left of the altarpiece’s main axis.  Martha, on the other hand, stands just right of centre and her body points slightly to the left, thus indicating that her original position was most likely on the other side.  All three saints have points in common with the figures in Luini's Lamentation in the Szépmüvészeti Múzeum, Budapest, and the clothed figures of Peter and Martha are generically similar to those gathered around the Dead Christ in Luini's later Lamentation, painted for the church of San Giorgio, Milan, in 1516.  The fact that the Saint Sebastian is the only signed and dated panel from the group is important, not only in securing 1510 as the date of execution for the entire polyptych but also for confirming beyond any doubt the three panels’ authorship.  It was not until the second decade of the 16th century that Luini’s style developed recognisably into his own, somewhat formulaic on the one hand but deeply influenced by Raphael and Leonardo on the other. Indeed one should assume that Luini’s style entered into its more ‘Leonardesque’ phase only after Leonardo’s second Milanese sojourn, which took place from 1508 to 1513."

        "description": "The panel reveals the intensity of the links that this artist from Varese maintained with the Lombard Late Gothic tradition which is responsible, for example, for his meticulous depiction of plants and flowers in the background. At the same time, however, we see Luini subscribing to the style of Leonardo da Vinci, not only in the Virgin’s facial features but also in the pose of the Christ Child, whom several scholars have likened to Leonardo’s study of a Madonna and Child with a Cat. Jesus is clutching a columbine whose colour alludes both to the blood of Christ and to the grief of his mother."

        "description": "The Madonna of the Carnation, by Bernardino Luini, shows the Virgin with the Christ child seated in her lap as he turns to grasp a carnation growing in a pot nearby. This may seem like an everyday gesture, but during the Renaissance a carnation symbolized either the Crucifixion or the Virgin's pure love. Thus the painting suggests that Christ, even as an infant, embraced his future sacrifice on the cross, while his mother's pensive expression implies her comprehension of what his action signifies.\n\nThough not as well known today, Luini was once considered the leading painter from the Lombardy region of northern Italy. He was born about 1480 and trained with several local masters, but his life and art were transformed by encountering the work of Leonardo da Vinci, who visited Milan once in the late 15th century and again briefly in the early 16th century. Leonardo, as a young artist in Florence, painted several pictures with the same theme as that seen in this painting: the Christ child reaching for a flower. And it seems clear that Luini is indebted to Leonardo not only for this poignant theme but for other aspects of the painting as well: the dark background, the softness of the forms, the chiaroscuro (light and dark) modeling, the sweet sentiment of the figures, the turning pose of the Child.\n\nLuini was a great painter of religious images, including frescoes, wood panels, large altarpieces, and small devotional works for the home. He was obviously very popular in his own time, as there are countless copies of his paintings. Then he regained popularity in the 19th century when the famous critic John Ruskin decided that Luini was greater than Leonardo, and many readers went to Italy looking for his works."

To the composition made by the Tuscan genius, Luini added the figure of Saint Joseph to the left of the Virgin."

        "description": "The architecture of the Aula Leonardi is dominated by a majestic fresco by one of Leonardo da Vinci’s most mature and original followers, Bernardino Luini. The subject of this mural painting is clearly explained by the cartouche at the top of the central bay, which bears the title of the work itself: Caput regis gloriae spinis coronatur (“The Head of the King of Glory Crowned with Thorns”). The scene is divided into three distinct parts. At the centre, Christ is wearing a scarlet mantle and holding a cane as though it were a sceptre, and he appears to be seated on a sort of throne. His wrists are tied by a rope and on his head he wears a crown of thorns. He is surrounded by several soldiers who insult and mock him with strange grimaces, while two of them, who are closest to him, look as though they intend to beat on the crown of thorns with sticks, to press it deeper into his flesh. The two sides, on the other hand, show the twelve members of the Confraternita di Santa Corona, who commissioned the fresco from Bernardino Luini. There are six on each side, kneeling and wrapped in heavy black cloaks. Before it was taken over by the Ambrosiana, this hall was the chapter house of the confraternity, which was named after the Holy Crown of Christ and devoted to charitable work."

At her mother’s urging, Salome requested the head of John the Baptist, who had criticized her mother’s marriage. During the Renaissance, John’s head on a platter was widely understood to be a symbol for the Host, or sacramental bread in the Christian ritual of the Eucharist. Luini executed several paintings of Salome with the head of the Baptist where the beautiful faces belie the brutal violence of decapitation. The technique of contours blurred by delicate shadows and the specific facial types reveal the strong influence of Leonardo da Vinci."

He repeated Leonardo's favourite themes and types, making virtuoso use of sfumato, the soft misty chiaroscuro which seems to surround objects. The colouring of this picture is deep and calm brown and golden tones emphasizing the dense noble crimson colour of the saint's clothing. At her sides are two small angels holding palm branches, the attributes of martyrdom, and a spiked wheel on which, according to legend, Roman Emperor Maximinus ordered to torture St Catherine for her loyalty to the Christian faith ."

It is known in numerous versions, some of a quality comparable to this, and the composition was enormously famous.\n\nPainting is on the National Gallery, London, UK. Currently not on display."
